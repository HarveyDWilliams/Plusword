[12/06/2022, 08:39:46] Joe: I imagine this is right - that's as close as I ever got to hearing of it though
[12/06/2022, 08:59:50] Tom: I went for a run instead aha
[12/06/2022, 08:59:55] Tom: But I am starting now
[12/06/2022, 09:21:09] Joe: 47a is Atalanta
[12/06/2022, 09:21:17] Joe: Probably

[12/06/2022, 09:21:28] Joe: Tough crossy imo
[12/06/2022, 09:21:57] Tom: Though I wouldn’t have got that one so thanks
[12/06/2022, 09:21:57] Joe: Oh, I didn't realise I was meant to be filling it in myself
[12/06/2022, 09:22:03] Joe: Good
[12/06/2022, 09:49:39] Harvey Williams: God I suck at general knowledge

[14/06/2022, 10:52:37] Joe: I was also thrown by 6a "steer clear of" - I got the second letter and thought I knew it
[14/06/2022, 11:36:05] Harvey Williams: I couldn't get 5d for a while
[14/06/2022, 11:36:12] Harvey Williams: And all I could think was
[14/06/2022, 11:36:19] Harvey Williams: I bet Tom got this in like 2 seconds

[15/06/2022, 10:07:56] Joe: I got stuck on the plusword, had a letter in a forbidden place for way too long getting annoyed at it for not accepting my word 🤦🏻‍♂️
[15/06/2022, 10:08:17] Joe: 1a I don't get either yeah, "smart"...
[15/06/2022, 10:09:11] Joe: Okay after googling I do get it but I don't really think it's a thing that people say

[16/06/2022, 09:45:30] Harvey Williams: Really took me some time to get started on this one
[16/06/2022, 09:45:34] Harvey Williams: A lot of second guessing
[16/06/2022, 09:45:45] Tom: I had a look at today’s and none of them look obvious

[17/06/2022, 11:39:08] Joe: Yeah I had a wrong one in there for a bit
[17/06/2022, 11:39:21] Joe: But 2d set me straight
[17/06/2022, 11:39:24] Harvey Williams: I suspect your bit was a lot shorter than mine
[17/06/2022, 11:39:31] Joe: Ha true
[17/06/2022, 11:40:14] Harvey Williams: 5d finally sorted me out after ages

[17/06/2022, 14:04:40] Joe: Hah yeah I got the wordle by guessing every letter

[18/06/2022, 10:25:26] Tom: Anagram
[18/06/2022, 10:25:38] Harvey Williams: Ohhh
[18/06/2022, 10:25:58] Harvey Williams: I just blanked on that being anagram
[18/06/2022, 10:26:11] Harvey Williams: I was thinking of synonym
[18/06/2022, 10:26:16] Harvey Williams: Stupid stupid

[20/06/2022, 09:18:07] Harvey Williams: Also sodas, sleds and nests stress clearly a favourite amongst the constructors
[20/06/2022, 09:19:54] Harvey Williams: Also I think for the first time the solution wasn't unique, is queue not a valid answer to the plusword?
[20/06/2022, 09:20:06] Harvey Williams: Oh wait no o

[20/06/2022, 21:08:01] Tom: It’s not a word

[20/06/2022, 23:24:52] Joe: Did he meet the entry requirements?
[20/06/2022, 23:25:19] Harvey Williams: He sent me a screenshot of a time
[20/06/2022, 23:25:23] Harvey Williams: So I believe so
[20/06/2022, 23:25:30] Harvey Williams: Feel free to further investigate
[20/06/2022, 23:25:55] Harvey Williams: If he's found wanting action will be taken
[20/06/2022, 23:26:57] Joe: I will continually assess his adequacy
[20/06/2022, 23:27:12] Joe: Is it still unthinkable for Sarah to be inducted?
[20/06/2022, 23:27:33] Harvey Williams: She's yet to prove her worth
[20/06/2022, 23:27:40] Harvey Williams: I assume Tom explained the rules to her
[20/06/2022, 23:27:43] Joe: @447895637641 this is the standard to meet
[20/06/2022, 23:28:19] George Sheen: A blurred button picture that does nothing when pressed
[20/06/2022, 23:28:22] Joe: This shocks me
[20/06/2022, 23:28:23] George Sheen: It's too good to be seen
[20/06/2022, 23:28:26] George Sheen: A holy artifact
[20/06/2022, 23:29:14] Harvey Williams: For the benefit of our new member, I'll remind you all that this is for plusword chat exclusively. No memes, banter, or tomfoolery.
[20/06/2022, 23:31:07] George Sheen: Expression of penitence or regret (5)

[21/06/2022, 10:30:12] Joe: We all tried harder because we had someone else's time to beat

[22/06/2022, 00:36:39] Joe: I couldn't even think of guesses for most of them for a good while
[22/06/2022, 09:10:58] Harvey Williams: It's not looking good for me boys
[22/06/2022, 09:11:08] Harvey Williams: I have every letter but the last 4 of 1a
[22/06/2022, 09:11:15] Harvey Williams: And I still can't get any of the down clues

[22/06/2022, 10:00:49] Harvey Williams: Okay I realised by 8a was wrong
[22/06/2022, 10:00:55] Harvey Williams: And now we're stuck there instead
[22/06/2022, 10:02:34] Joe: Are you doing it with Leah?
[22/06/2022, 10:02:37] Joe: Or is that a royal "we"?
[22/06/2022, 10:03:30] George Sheen: I'm going with the latter, but Harvey should capitalise on this opportunity to shift blame onto someone else
[22/06/2022, 10:04:42] Harvey Williams: It's a royal we
[22/06/2022, 10:18:46] Harvey Williams: Tom I need you to do this one
[22/06/2022, 10:18:53] Tom: Why
[22/06/2022, 10:19:01] Harvey Williams: Because I'm going crazy
[22/06/2022, 10:19:05] Tom: I’ve started it
[22/06/2022, 10:19:07] Harvey Williams: And need to know there's shared suffering
[22/06/2022, 10:19:14] Tom: Yeah it’s hard today

[22/06/2022, 10:43:29] Harvey Williams: I had the plusword for so long

[23/06/2022, 09:43:07] George Sheen: Need to start plotting performance against time initiated to understand the window of peak arousal
[23/06/2022, 09:49:44] Harvey Williams: I often do it past midnight which I know is a mistake but I'm too damn excited to pass up on it

[23/06/2022, 09:50:42] George Sheen: I'm exactly the same with wanking

[27/06/2022, 12:46:55] George Sheen: Apparently it's common for Old French verbs with iss to gain an h in English (as in abash) but abase was for the mavericks who weren't all about that convention

[29/06/2022, 09:19:08] George Sheen: Joe and I were also discussing the pitfalls of guessing that Italian Soprano's name yesterday, he went Marie and I went Mario initially
[29/06/2022, 09:19:19] George Sheen: Made getting seamy along the bottom more difficult

[29/06/2022, 10:01:13] Harvey Williams: I had seedy for ages
[29/06/2022, 10:01:25] Harvey Williams: So for the fish I had bread

[29/06/2022, 16:36:14] Tom: Yeah they were the two hard ones for me
[29/06/2022, 16:36:37] Tom: Actually Adobe wasn’t

[30/06/2022, 08:30:04] George Sheen: Yeah it was a bit of a dickhead, I tried three other valid answers before getting it
[30/06/2022, 08:31:00] Harvey Williams: I wish it coloured the letter in on the keyboard like wordle
[30/06/2022, 08:32:06] George Sheen: How do you mean?
[30/06/2022, 08:32:32] Harvey Williams: Wordle shows which letters are no good on the keyword by shading them
[30/06/2022, 08:32:59] George Sheen: Also this was a lie, I just realised the letters I used were in the grid and not coloured in. It never actually occurred to me to check to see if any of the letters you are considering are in the grid and not coloured in before guessing
[30/06/2022, 08:33:19] George Sheen: Ahh yeah that would definitely help
[30/06/2022, 08:33:41] George Sheen: Telegraph is for boomers who are afraid of such technology leading to a pleasant user experience
[30/06/2022, 08:35:30] George Sheen: This would really stoke the flames of the already raging mobile vs keyboard debate

[30/06/2022, 17:12:44] Joe: All
[30/06/2022, 17:13:14] Joe: Google says it's "repair" though... "Recognition" sounded right to me
[30/06/2022, 17:13:52] Joe: Maybe just because you said it first...
[30/06/2022, 17:22:36] Harvey Williams: Things I say are good
[30/06/2022, 17:55:46] George Sheen: Yeah I thought it was FU Beyond All Recognition

‎[01/07/2022, 09:42:15] Joe: ‎<attached: 00000596-PHOTO-2022-07-01-09-42-15.jpg>
[01/07/2022, 09:42:40] Joe: Hmm I have a guess at 7a but I can't explain without spoilers
[01/07/2022, 10:19:51] George Sheen: I'll do it now, and then we can all wait 9 hours for Whittington to finally do it so we can open communication channels
[01/07/2022, 10:20:11] Tom: I’ve got 3 so far
[01/07/2022, 10:20:13] George Sheen: He's probably prioritising his "exams" and his "future" 🙄
[01/07/2022, 10:20:16] Tom: I just do it in chunks
[01/07/2022, 10:20:23] Tom: Unless it’s a really easy one
[01/07/2022, 10:20:48] George Sheen: Do you just close it and the timer stops?
[01/07/2022, 10:20:55] Tom: Yup
[01/07/2022, 10:21:05] George Sheen: Intriguing
[01/07/2022, 10:21:16] George Sheen: I don't think I'd be able to stagger my dopamine rush like that
[01/07/2022, 10:21:26] George Sheen: I need to plunge the syringe all the way to the bottom
[01/07/2022, 10:21:28] Tom: You might lose a few seconds  but my with times it doesn’t matter too much

[01/07/2022, 10:32:34] George Sheen: finish your dinner tom
[01/07/2022, 10:33:45] Harvey Williams: Yeah I open it at night and if I feel too tired immediately I wait till the morning and it just pauses
[01/07/2022, 10:35:00] George Sheen: One day your subconscious will work it out and the completed board will be shown to you in a dream

[01/07/2022, 10:50:40] George Sheen: This feels dirty and like I've brought the game into disrepute, so I'd like to publicly apologise
[01/07/2022, 11:08:31] Joe: Well I forgot what the wordle was
[01/07/2022, 11:08:44] Joe: I didn't check anything before re-attempting
[01/07/2022, 11:08:53] Joe: I can forget a lot in an hour

[02/07/2022, 00:16:42] Harvey Williams: Was flying through it but had 1 letter wrong and it cost me 2 mins D:
[02/07/2022, 00:16:45] Tom: Bravo!
[02/07/2022, 00:16:54] Harvey Williams: One of the easier ones today I think
[02/07/2022, 00:17:37] Harvey Williams: 5d is lost on me
[02/07/2022, 00:17:46] Harvey Williams: And 8a never heard of either
[02/07/2022, 00:17:50] Tom: Meaning?
[02/07/2022, 00:18:06] Harvey Williams: Yeah
[02/07/2022, 11:23:32] George Sheen: Nightmare

[02/07/2022, 11:23:59] George Sheen: I fucked it on the Plusword, I had one of the letters in a column where it was orange without realising
[02/07/2022, 11:24:08] George Sheen: Me neither
[02/07/2022, 11:24:32] George Sheen: I just about understand this although only it retrospect, not at the time
[02/07/2022, 11:26:03] George Sheen: On that note, with the debate around usage yesterday (I think it was that), it just meant employ in the sense of to use. Like to employ a tool (formal but does make sense). So employment = usage
[02/07/2022, 11:26:21] Harvey Williams: Yeah Joe sent on a message
[02/07/2022, 11:26:36] Harvey Williams: I think when I first did the puzzle I was thinking of unemployment
[02/07/2022, 11:26:53] Harvey Williams: So I thought it was a weird legal term for unemployed people
[02/07/2022, 11:28:17] George Sheen: Yeah I think they do it on purpose, choosing secondary meanings
[02/07/2022, 11:28:57] George Sheen: 5d today is similar although in some ways the opposite
[02/07/2022, 11:29:09] George Sheen: I was going to waffle on more but I'll wait until others have attempted it
[02/07/2022, 11:30:17] George Sheen: They force you into doing system 2 thinking when your brain wants to do system 1 and we don't like that (and so usually do the path of least resistance and get the easy ones and fill in the letters for the difficult ones afterwards)
[02/07/2022, 12:21:10] Joe: I'm losing it on the plusword
[02/07/2022, 12:21:34] Joe: wordle*
[02/07/2022, 12:21:35] Joe: If the same letter appears twice in a row, once green and once yellow, then we know it's used twice in the wordle right?
[02/07/2022, 12:21:40] Joe: The same as in classic wordle
[02/07/2022, 12:22:51] Joe: And I can't think of any words with that first letter followed by a consonant
[02/07/2022, 12:23:03] Joe: But I've tried every other combo
[02/07/2022, 12:23:16] Joe: Unless my grid is wrong, but that's unthinkable at this point
[02/07/2022, 12:27:44] Harvey Williams: Yes
[02/07/2022, 12:28:53] Harvey Williams: Send me your grid

[04/07/2022, 10:06:53] Tom: Glad to see my £9000 a year education is helping my plusword times

[04/07/2022, 12:33:00] George Sheen: And you need to bank on a straightforward plusword
[04/07/2022, 12:33:25] Joe: Well done on the chat's second ever sub 1 minute
[04/07/2022, 12:33:26] George Sheen: Very well done
[04/07/2022, 12:39:21] Joe: Thank you. It is nice to be recognised

[05/07/2022, 09:25:02] Harvey Williams: Has one wrong letter in the grid
[05/07/2022, 09:25:08] Harvey Williams: Tiny brain stuff
[05/07/2022, 09:25:24] Harvey Williams: Spend 16 mins on the plusword

[05/07/2022, 10:01:28] Joe: 16 minute wordle is painful
[05/07/2022, 10:04:31] Harvey Williams: Yeah I was just too tired
[05/07/2022, 10:04:37] Harvey Williams: I actually got the word first try
[05/07/2022, 10:04:48] Harvey Williams: And instead of believing in myself and doubting the grid
[05/07/2022, 10:05:05] Harvey Williams: And also just knowing that if I find a valid word then it must be it or one of its letters in the grid
[05/07/2022, 10:05:17] Harvey Williams: I just floundered D:
[05/07/2022, 10:06:14] Joe: 😔 doing plusword so early is a dangerous game
[05/07/2022, 14:00:27] Tom: Fuck this word
[05/07/2022, 14:05:33] Joe: I got it with a good guess at 4 of the positions then trying every letter for the last 🌞

[06/07/2022, 10:14:56] Joe: Wtf plusword
[06/07/2022, 10:15:05] Joe: This may be unfinishable
[06/07/2022, 10:29:38] Joe: Okay I completed it in 14 minutes something, but I cheated and googled a couple of things so cannot in good conscience share a screenshot
[06/07/2022, 10:30:07] Joe: In hindsight maybe I could have got more, but I had a couple of bad answers in which made things harder
[06/07/2022, 10:30:51] Joe: But I was only able to enter a couple with any confidence at all (and one of those turned out to be wrong anyway), before I started entering guesses
[06/07/2022, 10:31:59] Harvey Williams: I'll be attempting soon
[06/07/2022, 10:32:01] Harvey Williams: Wish me luck

[06/07/2022, 11:30:54] Joe: Yeah 5d is one of the ones I felt fairly confident on, but was wrong
[06/07/2022, 11:31:42] Harvey Williams: Yeah I probably had what you had for 5d for a while
[06/07/2022, 11:31:43] George Sheen: Me too, I'd also say the clue for the one along the bottom wasn't even a synonym
[06/07/2022, 11:32:44] Joe: Yeah I had something different in 9a as well, though not with much confidence
[06/07/2022, 11:33:18] Joe: I think it is a legit synonym though

[06/07/2022, 11:34:48] George Sheen: It is inarguable, I must admit
[06/07/2022, 11:37:30] Harvey Williams: Do we need one chat for each combination of players for spoiler-full discussion
[06/07/2022, 11:37:55] George Sheen: Yes, including all 2 player combinations
[06/07/2022, 11:37:57] Harvey Williams: Our other option being extreme peer pressure

[06/07/2022, 12:18:52] Joe: Truth 🤑
[06/07/2022, 12:19:52] George Sheen: Tom's prioritising his medical exams this week (meaningless; untransferrable skills) over his daily Plusword exam (very important; IQ augmenting; enduring  reinforcer of one's self-esteem)
[06/07/2022, 12:19:59] George Sheen: 🙄

[06/07/2022, 13:20:46] Tom: Nope
[06/07/2022, 13:20:52] George Sheen: Good, me neither

[06/07/2022, 13:25:03] George Sheen: Actually a far more nuanced game than chess irrespective of how many dimensions it's inflated by
[06/07/2022, 13:26:32] Joe: I prefer planerider
[06/07/2022, 13:35:41] Harvey Williams: Hulls was my first guess

[06/07/2022, 13:36:34] Harvey Williams: I thought canoe would be a much more nautical word
[06/07/2022, 13:36:39] Harvey Williams: Like a frigate or something

[08/07/2022, 11:37:34] Harvey Williams: You'll all be happy to know I did know that word
[08/07/2022, 11:38:21] Harvey Williams: Feel like there needs to be a 7a discussion
[08/07/2022, 11:39:23] Joe: Oh yeah I forgot 7a, it makes me uncomfortable
[08/07/2022, 11:40:09] Joe: The tennis word I used to say wrong for years, I thought it was something different that sounds similar...
[08/07/2022, 11:43:08] Harvey Williams: I think I can imagine what you said
[08/07/2022, 11:52:16] Joe: I never understood why it was called that, and now that I know the actual word I still don't understand

[09/07/2022, 11:45:16] Joe: Have you been stuck for 3 hours?
[09/07/2022, 11:45:21] Joe: My timer seems normal
[09/07/2022, 11:45:25] Harvey Williams: I wish that was the case
[09/07/2022, 11:46:01] Harvey Williams: I wasn't even awake until 15 mins ago

[10/07/2022, 10:48:23] Harvey Williams: Thank you for reporting this to me, we must uphold our high standards.

[10/07/2022, 10:55:07] Harvey Williams: Yesterday's world's
[10/07/2022, 10:55:12] Harvey Williams: Plusword
[10/07/2022, 10:55:16] Harvey Williams: Another two wordwr
[10/07/2022, 10:55:19] Harvey Williams: At sea?
[10/07/2022, 10:55:51] Harvey Williams: Maybe we should write in and insist they add traditional crossword multiple word indicators like (2,3)

[10/07/2022, 11:00:14] George Sheen: I lost a minute to that too
[10/07/2022, 11:00:48] George Sheen: Thankfully I know I've missed less than Tom, so I'll wait until he's thrown out before upping my game
[10/07/2022, 11:01:26] Harvey Williams: Oh we have a behind the scene loyalty system in place, don't think yourself so comfortably placed.
[10/07/2022, 11:48:31] Joe: Yeah that messed with me. George started yesterday's plusword and got "atsea" basically instantaneously though
[10/07/2022, 11:48:36] Joe: George = sus imo
[10/07/2022, 11:49:24] Harvey Williams: Feel like I've now got to retrain my brain for 2,3 and 3,2 answers
[10/07/2022, 12:29:31] Tom: Funny
[10/07/2022, 12:29:50] Joe: Retro
[10/07/2022, 12:30:00] Joe: I think I'd rather just not get such answers
[10/07/2022, 12:30:11] Joe: There's definitely enough 5 letter answers that they don't need top

[11/07/2022, 09:47:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: none of this 3,2 nonsense
[11/07/2022, 09:49:54] George Sheen: Easy but requiring just a splash of worldly knowledge
[11/07/2022, 09:50:05] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: that's how I like it
[11/07/2022, 09:51:08] George Sheen: Putting you into that beautiful flow state that exists between boredom and perplexity, and ready to kickstart a working week with a gleeful spring in your step

[11/07/2022, 10:48:49] Harvey Williams: I just read it and it's actually a newsletter pop up

[11/07/2022, 12:37:02] George Sheen: Yes and it's annoying
[11/07/2022, 12:38:15] George Sheen: Also do any other pkeyers find that it starts by having the first row highlighted, so you start typing, but nothing happens so you click it to start the input but it switches to the vertical instead
[11/07/2022, 12:38:25] George Sheen: Gets me every time
[11/07/2022, 12:38:30] George Sheen: Ruins my day every time
[11/07/2022, 12:44:11] Harvey Williams: Sound like a pkey issue
[11/07/2022, 12:45:27] George Sheen: It is. I need aim assist ☹️
[11/07/2022, 13:01:01] Joe: Yes I have that problem
[11/07/2022, 13:01:11] Joe: I have it on both pc and phone
[11/07/2022, 13:02:12] George Sheen: Fucking Torygraph
[11/07/2022, 13:02:35] George Sheen: Program their website by writing code onto a parchment with quill and ink and feeding it into an OCR
[11/07/2022, 13:03:09] George Sheen: I need to get into the habit of starting with 1D or the muscle memory of double clicking before starting but it's not there yet
[11/07/2022, 13:11:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: typing the wrong way is a core part of the online crossword experience
[11/07/2022, 13:11:10] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I wouldn't have it any other way
[11/07/2022, 13:12:23] George Sheen: I just wish there was a transpose button so I could fill it out reversed and then fix it at the end
[11/07/2022, 13:12:32] George Sheen: Rather than go through the humiliation of having to delete a letter

[11/07/2022, 18:25:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: did you sign up for the telegraph
[11/07/2022, 18:28:07] Harvey Williams: I'm hoping it resolves my newsletter issue
[11/07/2022, 18:28:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: they're not inviting me to join their newsletter
[11/07/2022, 18:29:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: am I not good enough for them
[11/07/2022, 18:29:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: gotta get those scores down so they want me
[11/07/2022, 18:29:52] Harvey Williams: You must be poorly informed

[13/07/2022, 10:16:36] George Sheen: I think so
[13/07/2022, 10:16:49] George Sheen: Also these photos of the screen are iconic
[13/07/2022, 10:16:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: alive and vigorous do not mean the same thing

[13/07/2022, 10:22:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I have spent my entire life alive and I have spent very little of it being vigorous
[13/07/2022, 10:22:37] Harvey Williams: Shit bro
[13/07/2022, 10:23:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: love the drop shadow on alive there

[13/07/2022, 10:25:57] George Sheen: "in the pink"
[13/07/2022, 10:26:32] George Sheen: So if I've got 2 in the pink and 1 in the stink, does that mean I'm feeling 66% lively and vigorous and 33% bad?
[13/07/2022, 10:26:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I am a "full of beans" enjoyer
[13/07/2022, 10:26:44] George Sheen: (and 100% alive because it's a prerequisite to feeling anything)
[13/07/2022, 10:27:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: prerequisites do not a clue make
[13/07/2022, 10:27:54] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I will die on this hill
[13/07/2022, 10:28:06] George Sheen: I agree with you
[13/07/2022, 10:28:18] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: how vigorously do you agree
[13/07/2022, 10:28:21] George Sheen: I think the only time alive means vigorous is if you come alive
[13/07/2022, 10:28:53] George Sheen: But that's using a different verb (you'd have to become vigorous, coming vigorous would mean something else indeed) so it's not a very good synonym
[13/07/2022, 10:29:07] Joe: I feel vigorous = I feel alive
[13/07/2022, 10:29:14] George Sheen: 50% vigor and 50% vim in my agreement
[13/07/2022, 10:29:36] George Sheen: I feel alive is not permitted in British English
[13/07/2022, 10:30:00] George Sheen: That's for cringeworthy 18 year old Americans after their first time smoking weed at college but failing to inhale
[13/07/2022, 10:34:57] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also for queen in don't stop me now
[13/07/2022, 10:35:47] George Sheen: Hard to argue with that
[13/07/2022, 10:35:49] George Sheen: They do speak the Queen's English
[13/07/2022, 10:36:22] Harvey Williams: Not sure where you're seeing in the pink, that clearly says alive.
[14/07/2022, 09:20:19] Harvey Williams: I'm 30 seconds in
[14/07/2022, 09:20:26] Harvey Williams: And ive got a bad feeling about this one
[14/07/2022, 09:21:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: if you fancy taking 15 minutes plus it'll make me feel better about yesterday's result for me

[14/07/2022, 10:01:41] George Sheen: Yeah there are some very sussy trees just gagging to have bark erroneously applied to them
[14/07/2022, 10:02:59] George Sheen: Although it's just occurred to me that phrase probably refers to when a dog barks up at an animal in the tree
[14/07/2022, 10:09:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: did you really truly think barking up the wrong tree meant applying bark to a tree like wallpaper

[14/07/2022, 10:11:00] Harvey Williams: I love the idea that trees require some process of applying bark to them and that you could also do it to the wrong tree.

[18/07/2022, 10:17:15] Tom: How many 5 letter words are there?
[18/07/2022, 10:17:36] Tom: No one in this group has a memory better than a goldfish (except me ofc)
[18/07/2022, 10:17:38] Harvey Williams: I guess it's just hard to not give a lot of green letters for this one
[18/07/2022, 10:18:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i am pretty sure the clue was something like "a useful talent" and I was trying to cram "skill" in and it wouldn't fit
[18/07/2022, 10:19:13] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I wonder how much mileage he can get out of a single word

[20/07/2022, 12:59:35] Joe: I read harvey's spoiler message but all that I remembered was something about clothes lining and it didn't help
[20/07/2022, 12:59:45] Harvey Williams: My bad on that one
[20/07/2022, 12:59:46] Joe: Very silly indeed
[20/07/2022, 13:00:11] Harvey Williams: I didn't actually know what tripe was
[20/07/2022, 13:00:20] Tom: Yeah it’s pretty grim
[20/07/2022, 13:00:22] Harvey Williams: I'd only heard it in the context of call something someone said tripe
[20/07/2022, 13:00:40] Tom: That’s the only one knew 😔
[20/07/2022, 13:00:45] Joe: I knew it was some sort of offal
[20/07/2022, 13:00:51] Joe: George and I saw a picture of it on Only Connect recently
[20/07/2022, 13:00:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I only knew tripe was meat but not good meat

[20/07/2022, 13:01:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: didn't know it was stomach lining specifically
[20/07/2022, 13:01:10] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what a treat
[20/07/2022, 13:01:24] Tom: The picture of it make it look even worse than I imagined
‎[20/07/2022, 13:01:37] Joe: ‎<attached: 00001218-PHOTO-2022-07-20-13-01-37.jpg>

[20/07/2022, 13:01:41] Tom: But then again it it any grosser than eating pig intestines
[20/07/2022, 13:01:44] Joe: I'd never heard of lariat
[20/07/2022, 13:01:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think that's what got me the sub 3m mark
[20/07/2022, 13:01:51] Tom: I hadn’t either
[20/07/2022, 13:01:55] Tom: So nice one for that
[20/07/2022, 13:02:14] Tom: So when are we going to have the first annual plusword meet-up?
[20/07/2022, 13:02:41] Joe: 2023
[20/07/2022, 13:02:47] Tom: Interesting how they think bleaching the tripe removes all the protein from it
[20/07/2022, 13:03:15] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: has anyone ever tried it
[20/07/2022, 13:04:12] Tom: Nope, I’ve had heart, kidney, liver, tongue but I think other organs are too grim
[20/07/2022, 13:04:19] Tom: Kidney is grim actually
[20/07/2022, 13:04:31] Tom: Hutch definitely will have though
[20/07/2022, 13:04:48] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I wish I could try these things without knowing what they are
[20/07/2022, 13:04:59] Tom: Oh yeah definitely
[20/07/2022, 13:05:15] Tom: Chicken liver pâté is quite innocuous
[20/07/2022, 13:05:24] Tom: And heart was just like meaty chicken
[20/07/2022, 13:05:29] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: if someone serves it up like "try this delicious bleached cow stomach lining" I guarantee I'm not enjoying that
[20/07/2022, 13:06:20] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: apparently a staple food in the UK until the late 20th century so it can't be too bad, right?
[20/07/2022, 13:06:32] Tom: Old people have horrible taste
[20/07/2022, 13:06:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: cut it up and drench it in sauces, call it a British doner kebab and I'm in
[20/07/2022, 13:06:49] Tom: And I think they ate a lot more offal during the war
[20/07/2022, 13:06:55] Tom: Ahahah that’s genius
[20/07/2022, 13:17:43] Joe: Liver was gross enough to put me off all organs at a young age
[20/07/2022, 13:17:51] Joe: Though yeah that doesn't apply to paté
[20/07/2022, 13:18:35] Tom: Also I think cow liver is significantly grimmer than chicken liver

[22/07/2022, 11:03:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: v generous to give us an anagram on 4d to avoid me spending minutes trying to cram words in around "space" on 8a though

[23/07/2022, 10:54:53] Harvey Williams: 4d and 5d were both new to me
[23/07/2022, 10:55:15] Harvey Williams: Never heard of 9a clue
[23/07/2022, 10:55:28] Harvey Williams: And didn't know that 6a was what 6a was
[23/07/2022, 11:53:41] George Sheen: Yeah I've never heard of 4d and 6a and particularly 8a took me a while

[24/07/2022, 19:44:53] Harvey Williams: I also had the first letter of 5d wrong for ages
[24/07/2022, 19:45:22] Harvey Williams: Also I didn't know that 2d was a word
[24/07/2022, 19:45:31] Harvey Williams: I thought it was another similar sounding word
[24/07/2022, 20:28:11] Joe: Hmm I guess I know which letter you had in 5d
[24/07/2022, 20:28:25] Joe: Presumably the same as what you were putting in 2d
[24/07/2022, 20:43:13] Tom: Discuss freely guys

[26/07/2022, 09:57:53] George Sheen: I reckon there's room for a sub 1 minute here, I fannied about on the plusword too long
[26/07/2022, 09:58:35] George Sheen: It's a word that noncy people who are into wine and other fragrant alcohols might noncily throw about

[26/07/2022, 10:02:59] George Sheen: Not really, Harvey's a failed chemist, Tom is a regretful chemist, and I'm a cognitively dissonant nonce
[26/07/2022, 10:03:24] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so a bit of both

[26/07/2022, 10:09:39] George Sheen: You've got it all worked out huh kid
[26/07/2022, 10:09:56] Harvey Williams: I also had a more Pokémon fan friendly answer in 8 for a while

[26/07/2022, 10:11:13] George Sheen: The goober's elixir
[26/07/2022, 10:11:46] George Sheen: (it's fine Tom and Joe are disgustingly Poké-illiterate)
[26/07/2022, 10:12:58] Harvey Williams: They couldn't tell a pichu from a plusle
[26/07/2022, 10:15:53] George Sheen: Accordingly to a shitty online quiz it looks like there might be 44 Pokémon with 5-letter names
[26/07/2022, 10:16:01] George Sheen: Which begs the question we've all been wondering
[26/07/2022, 10:16:09] George Sheen: Is a Plusleword possible?
[26/07/2022, 10:45:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I am looking at a list of Pokémon and I think I may have suffered brain damage

[26/07/2022, 10:46:21] George Sheen: Evolves into Yanmega (which was introduced gen 4)
[26/07/2022, 10:46:28] George Sheen: Yanma were really rare (and shit) in Gen 2
[26/07/2022, 10:46:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: is this the Mandela effect
[26/07/2022, 10:46:35] George Sheen: You could only catch them on one route
[26/07/2022, 10:46:40] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I come from a universe where there was no yanma
[26/07/2022, 10:46:56] George Sheen: It was off to the right hand side just before you enter the Goldenrod park from the south entrance
[26/07/2022, 10:47:11] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: UNOWN is 5 letters
[26/07/2022, 10:47:19] George Sheen: There was some loser bug catcher there and you had to take his number and he'd call you when there was a swarm, otherwise they were like 1% spawn chance
[26/07/2022, 10:47:40] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: bug catchers are the worst
[26/07/2022, 10:48:15] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the phone system in Pokémon gold & silver was great
[26/07/2022, 10:48:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what a game
[26/07/2022, 10:53:53] George Sheen: It was

[26/07/2022, 12:35:11] George Sheen: I've condensed the important parts of your master's degree in chemistry into 10 minutes browsing Quora, and so now am armed with the knowledge to say you're wrong and you need to tweet Chris Lancaster to apologise
[26/07/2022, 12:36:26] Tom: Chris needs to stick to his day job
[26/07/2022, 12:36:48] George Sheen: Stop stanning zwitterions

[27/07/2022, 09:49:17] George Sheen: Mistyped letters are the würst

[27/07/2022, 10:06:51] Harvey Williams: Yeah cycled through a few states before getting a start
[27/07/2022, 10:07:39] Harvey Williams: Without 5 I'd have been stuck for quite a while
[27/07/2022, 10:07:49] George Sheen: Not to mention all the five letter snakes there apparently are (in stark contrast with their legged lizard brethren)
[27/07/2022, 10:08:06] George Sheen: Not sure I understand 8 either
[27/07/2022, 10:08:30] George Sheen: 5 was a friendly one and I took a punt on 7 and was lucky it fit

[28/07/2022, 10:14:36] George Sheen: Knowing in advance that it's easy definitely helps me to get a better score, it means I go straight to looking at all the clues and firing in the easy ones
[28/07/2022, 10:14:55] George Sheen: I mean that's probably the optimal way of doing it anyway but normally I just go through each clue in series

[28/07/2022, 10:15:42] George Sheen: Let me get my phone
[28/07/2022, 10:15:45] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't think I even read half of the clues

[28/07/2022, 10:15:55] Tom: Obscene
[28/07/2022, 10:15:55] George Sheen: There we go
[28/07/2022, 10:16:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I saw all your times and just put in as much as I could as fast as I could
[28/07/2022, 10:16:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: could have been 30 if I wasn't repeatedly tricked by the direction swapping
[28/07/2022, 10:17:12] George Sheen: Yeah this is what I'm saying I think, you want to sort of process in parallel rather than in series (not that that makes any sense)
[28/07/2022, 10:17:20] George Sheen: But look at all the clues quickly and start with the easy ones
[28/07/2022, 10:17:33] George Sheen: Don't waste a second on any that don't immediately spring to mind
[28/07/2022, 10:17:40] George Sheen: At least we know it's beatable
[28/07/2022, 10:18:03] George Sheen: Sub 40 always felt a pipe dream to me
[28/07/2022, 10:19:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't think I'd have guessed "eared"
[28/07/2022, 10:20:29] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: spelled that one out by just getting all the vertical clues
[28/07/2022, 10:20:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I finished it before reading the clue for 9
[28/07/2022, 10:22:05] George Sheen: Yeah I went for eares on the assumption that arable farmers are illiterate and speak in dialectical English and so can't probably spell ears
[28/07/2022, 10:22:23] George Sheen: Also couldn't remember if the Swedish spell is krone or krona, it varies amongst the Scandi countries
[28/07/2022, 10:22:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: my ignorance saved me
[28/07/2022, 10:23:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: never knew it was spelled in any other way than krona
[28/07/2022, 10:23:56] Harvey Williams: The pkey sub 30 dream continues

[29/07/2022, 01:13:55] Harvey Williams: Living in regret doing it knackered before bed
[29/07/2022, 08:22:20] George Sheen: She appreciates the early submission at least
[29/07/2022, 08:22:48] George Sheen: She likes to mark them in bed over a fruity glass of shiraz

[29/07/2022, 10:21:23] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: got the wrong word for 6 and completely halted my progress for what felt like minutes
[29/07/2022, 10:27:13] Joe: I did the same with 8, I suspected it was wrong for a bit but it still delayed me for what felt like a long time

[29/07/2022, 12:53:44] Harvey Williams: I had faded in 8 for a while
[29/07/2022, 12:53:54] Harvey Williams: And refused to change it
[29/07/2022, 12:55:07] George Sheen: It is a better answer
[29/07/2022, 12:55:48] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I had expel instead of exile
[29/07/2022, 12:55:48] George Sheen: Paled implies a change in exposure/brightness levels to me whereas lost colour just means desaturated or lost definition
[29/07/2022, 12:56:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I was absolutely convinced it was right because what are the chances it's another word with x in that spot?
[29/07/2022, 12:56:26] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: out here just deleting correct answers to force my wrong ones in
[29/07/2022, 14:41:46] Joe: That's what I had
[29/07/2022, 14:42:23] George Sheen: I say what I'm about to say in the brazen knowledge that this may get me warned or removed from the elder council for heresy
[29/07/2022, 14:43:30] George Sheen: But I've been introduced to a new daily word game and this is the most relevant chat for it. HOWEVER I send it here only to show you shit it is compared to Plusword and to stress that it is never to be brought up again
[29/07/2022, 14:43:39] George Sheen: https://wafflegame.net/
[29/07/2022, 14:44:03] Joe: <Joe changed George's nickname to Waffle Boy>
[29/07/2022, 14:44:04] George Sheen: (it is better than most other false Plusword idols though)
[29/07/2022, 14:44:07] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: didn't read the game description
[29/07/2022, 14:44:10] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: clicked through
[29/07/2022, 14:44:16] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I have 15 turns to do... something
[29/07/2022, 14:44:31] George Sheen: Press the question mark in the top-right
[29/07/2022, 14:44:38] George Sheen: I also needed reminding of wtf was going on
[29/07/2022, 14:44:47] Joe: >Every WAFFLE can be solved in a minimum of 10 moves.
[29/07/2022, 14:44:49] Joe: I have my doubts
[29/07/2022, 14:46:05] George Sheen: I got it in 11 and each of my moves led to a letter in the right place
[29/07/2022, 14:46:45] George Sheen: So you'll really have to think ahead with it to get it in 10 which gets you 5 stars (I got 4). Anyway I shall never speak of this sacrilegious force again
[29/07/2022, 14:49:06] Joe: I got 2 stars
[29/07/2022, 14:49:07] Joe: I like it
[29/07/2022, 14:49:20] Joe: These doubts were misplaced, I hadn't read beyond that line yet
[29/07/2022, 14:50:18] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I solved the waffle with 3 swaps remaining
[29/07/2022, 14:50:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 3 stars
[29/07/2022, 14:52:14] George Sheen: Nice waffles
[29/07/2022, 15:00:48] Harvey Williams: I got 2 stars
[29/07/2022, 15:01:02] Harvey Williams: I also didn't fully understand it
[29/07/2022, 15:01:06] Harvey Williams: But now I do
[29/07/2022, 15:01:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: will we all be 5 star Wafflers tomorrow or will we remain true to the path of plusword
[29/07/2022, 15:02:00] George Sheen: I vehemently vote the latter
[29/07/2022, 15:02:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't think there are enough people in this chat for a real schism
[29/07/2022, 15:02:10] George Sheen: Plusword has taught me that I need time limits on my daily games
[29/07/2022, 15:02:19] George Sheen: Otherwise I spend too long thinking and optimising
[29/07/2022, 15:02:22] Joe: I always need more mind games to do when I should be working
[29/07/2022, 15:02:38] Joe: I'm happy to spend too long on em
[29/07/2022, 15:03:08] Harvey Williams: I think the only proper thing would be to make Waffle Gamers

[30/07/2022, 10:09:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I like seeing all the clues at once
[30/07/2022, 10:10:19] Harvey Williams: Classic pkey privilege
[30/07/2022, 10:10:53] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: had no idea about 2 or 3 and was very stupidly staring at 7 with no idea what it might mean for entirely too long
[30/07/2022, 10:12:19] Harvey Williams: 7 and 8 were my break-in
[30/07/2022, 10:12:49] Harvey Williams: I looked at 4 and was so sad I couldn't conjure the word
[30/07/2022, 10:13:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I got everything but 2, 3 and 7 pretty quick
[30/07/2022, 10:14:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: unfortunately I guessed for 2 and 3 and guessed wrong and half the letters being insane for 7 made it difficult to get the right answer
[30/07/2022, 10:14:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: think there's potential for a sub minute in this one for people who aren't weekend sleepy mode

[30/07/2022, 11:05:00] George Sheen: 3 was the one I didn't know which led to some ambiguity over 6 for me

[31/07/2022, 22:00:53] George Sheen: Can confirm that drinks often make the plusword section much harder than it can be
[31/07/2022, 22:01:16] George Sheen: 5 took me a while
[31/07/2022, 22:01:43] George Sheen: Seeing as we've all done it or opted out
[31/07/2022, 22:02:14] George Sheen: I had "yes" at the end and so was semi-convinced an eye problem had to begin with "eyes"
[31/07/2022, 22:02:47] George Sheen: 1a and 6 also didn't come very easily
[31/07/2022, 22:03:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: tally as agree is some shit
[31/07/2022, 22:04:42] George Sheen: Yeah I only got that because I had most of the down words, it wasn't intutiive to me at all (though I guess it makes sense that tally with = agree with)
[31/07/2022, 22:04:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also I am beginning to resent the 3,2 words return
[31/07/2022, 22:04:58] George Sheen: He loves choosing obscure definitions for common words though
[31/07/2022, 22:05:20] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: obscure and arguably wrong
[31/07/2022, 22:05:34] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i would contend that tally with means "corresponds with" in terms of figures
[31/07/2022, 22:05:42] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and not agrees
[31/07/2022, 22:05:44] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: there is a distinction
[31/07/2022, 22:06:30] George Sheen: Harness this drunken rage by tweeting him your contention
[31/07/2022, 22:06:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I spent a fair bit of time with "count" in tally, then when nothing made sense tried "marks"
[31/07/2022, 22:06:54] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: then thought maybe tsars was wrong and swapped it out for boyar which just caused absolute chaos
[31/07/2022, 22:07:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: all for want of a definition that made sense
[31/07/2022, 22:07:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: chris needs to get his shit together is all i am saying
[31/07/2022, 22:07:47] George Sheen: Oh yeah you've just made remember I went with "score" for tally as one of my first inputs which also made me delete tsars shortly afterwards
[31/07/2022, 22:07:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: score is an excellent one
[31/07/2022, 22:08:00] George Sheen: Thinking maybe there was a contemporary word for a Russian ruler post-Tsar
[31/07/2022, 22:08:30] George Sheen: Tell the man, he needs to hear it
[31/07/2022, 22:08:32] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what was stalin's actual title
[31/07/2022, 22:08:51] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: can you get General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into 5 characters

[01/08/2022, 11:05:07] George Sheen: You haven't heard of it because seven ate it

[01/08/2022, 11:35:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I went for STING, decided that was stupid and deleted it, then remembered manta rays exist and are bigger and felt like a genius

[01/08/2022, 11:38:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: well
[01/08/2022, 11:39:13] Tom: Chris apparently
[01/08/2022, 11:39:34] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i put "shall" in there and then went absolutely fucking mental because it didn't fit but what the fuck else could "will" starting with "shal" be
[01/08/2022, 11:39:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: Chris got me good
[01/08/2022, 11:43:00] George Sheen: Yeah fuck that
[01/08/2022, 11:43:06] George Sheen: I had SKINT in there and it ruined me
[01/08/2022, 11:43:19] George Sheen: Also pkey let me down today
[01/08/2022, 11:43:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I also went for SKINT
[01/08/2022, 11:43:57] George Sheen: Some bug meant when I clicked one it didn't highlight which clue it corresponded to, and didn't highlight the column or row. Had to keep refreshing to fix but it kept rebreaking
[01/08/2022, 11:44:29] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I keep ending up second guessing myself and removing ultimately correct guesses because of some arcane batshit clue referring to a word 4 people in the UK have ever actually heard
[01/08/2022, 11:44:39] George Sheen: Chris is going to end up legally STONY if he keeps producing such shit clues for such an important daily crossword
[01/08/2022, 11:46:53] Harvey Williams: Skint was the true answer
[01/08/2022, 11:50:32] George Sheen: So it looks like stony doesn't mean broke
[01/08/2022, 11:50:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: Chris' windows are going to get a bit stony if he doesn't stop this shite
[01/08/2022, 11:51:04] George Sheen: But there is a phrase "stony broke" (likely used by Chris and a small circle of his friends)
[01/08/2022, 11:51:21] George Sheen: This is not something I've heard, but I have heard the phrase it's derived from, "stone broke"
[01/08/2022, 11:51:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: stone broke is a phrase
[01/08/2022, 11:51:34] George Sheen: So stony broke is just an idiot's attempt at saying stone broke
[01/08/2022, 11:51:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I accept that
[01/08/2022, 11:51:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: stony broke is unacceptable
[01/08/2022, 11:51:56] George Sheen: Agreed
[01/08/2022, 11:54:48] Harvey Williams: We need a facemorphed angry version of Chris' face in sticker form for these moments

[02/08/2022, 11:03:18] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: we have at least one americanism
[02/08/2022, 11:03:28] Tom: Ok that’s good
[02/08/2022, 11:03:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: one clue which does not mean what the word means
[02/08/2022, 11:04:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: a classic Chris misadventure
[02/08/2022, 11:12:40] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: is it not going well
[02/08/2022, 11:15:11] Harvey Williams: Which one you stuck on tom
[02/08/2022, 11:15:20] Tom: All of them
[02/08/2022, 11:15:32] Tom: I’ve given up
[02/08/2022, 11:15:32] Harvey Williams: That's about as bad as it gets I'd say
[02/08/2022, 11:15:36] Harvey Williams: D:
[02/08/2022, 11:15:56] Tom: Yeah I’ve surrendered to Chris personally
[02/08/2022, 11:16:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I did 1 and 5 first
[02/08/2022, 11:16:07] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think
[02/08/2022, 11:16:27] Harvey Williams: 1a 5 then 1d was my first 3
[02/08/2022, 11:16:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 1, 5, 8
[02/08/2022, 11:16:57] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and the rest just fell into place
‎[02/08/2022, 11:21:06] Joe: ‎<attached: 00001763-PHOTO-2022-08-02-11-21-06.jpg>
[02/08/2022, 11:21:36] Joe: I had 4d wrong for ages, I thought that was the american answer
[02/08/2022, 11:21:53] Joe: Though I admit I'd already put in 1a as my American answer
[02/08/2022, 11:22:09] George Sheen: This again x2

[02/08/2022, 11:23:25] George Sheen: Made a really stupid single letter mistake on 2 which fucked up 7 and the Plusword royally
[02/08/2022, 11:23:40] George Sheen: .
[02/08/2022, 11:24:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: are we done then
[02/08/2022, 11:25:11] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 4 finishes and a given up
[02/08/2022, 11:29:32] George Sheen: If @447734470611 has given up
[02/08/2022, 11:29:40] George Sheen: Never know with his slimy piecemeal approach
[02/08/2022, 11:30:01] George Sheen: SOmetimes he does leave some hints though, for the keen eye
[02/08/2022, 11:30:07] George Sheen: spoiler away
[02/08/2022, 11:31:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 1 is an Americanism and I don't like it, bosun is spelled boatswain, nosey doesn't mean bad-smelling, and "adore" meaning enjoy greatly is iffy
[02/08/2022, 11:31:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I concede that you can adore food or activities but I would say mostly adoration is not enjoying something
[02/08/2022, 11:32:34] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also 8 is just french really
[02/08/2022, 11:32:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: but I got that one quickly so it's fine
[02/08/2022, 11:34:41] George Sheen: I knew that bangs was an American word for something hairy but I didn't actually realise it was just their word for fringe
[02/08/2022, 11:34:55] George Sheen: Possibly my new most hated Americanism
[02/08/2022, 11:35:38] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you have lived a blessed life to have not come across this
[02/08/2022, 11:36:08] George Sheen: I've also never heard nosey to mean bad-smelling (and nor have dictionaries apparently) so agree that is terrible
[02/08/2022, 11:37:28] George Sheen: I won't hold adore against Chris though and bosun is becoming more common nowadays... I mean Americans can't handle a silent u in colour, they were never going to handle the spelling of boatswain
[02/08/2022, 11:38:11] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: oh your baby is adorable
[02/08/2022, 11:38:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: oh your baby is... greatly enjoyable
[02/08/2022, 11:39:45] George Sheen: Possibly my favourite Lost Prophets lyric
[02/08/2022, 11:40:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: zing
[02/08/2022, 11:43:21] Harvey Williams: *oh your babe is great enjoyable
[02/08/2022, 11:43:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I greatly enjoyed your babes
[02/08/2022, 11:44:07] George Sheen: I mean even "I adored your babes" sounds sinister
[02/08/2022, 11:44:28] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: they were delectable
[02/08/2022, 11:44:29] George Sheen: It would prompt me to immediately run away to locate my babes
[02/08/2022, 12:00:04] Tom: Yeah I’ve given up
[02/08/2022, 12:00:16] Tom: Though the answers are making me feel better

[04/08/2022, 10:41:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also took about 5 seconds to get 1 at the start in what I think was some kind of "everyone else scored well" performance anxiety
[04/08/2022, 10:42:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think the timer should stop when you finish the crossword
[04/08/2022, 10:43:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: because I suck at the plus word bits specifically
[04/08/2022, 11:01:14] Tom: Yup me too
[04/08/2022, 11:02:07] Tom: I wouldn’t have got 9 without the other words finishing it for me

[04/08/2022, 11:11:35] Joe: To be honest I only got aspic quickly because of Don't Hug Me I'm Scared
[04/08/2022, 11:12:03] Joe: I also wasted a few precious seconds with my brain not working at the start, and also blamed everyone else for saying it was easy

[05/08/2022, 10:33:43] Harvey Williams: Knowing the last letter of 4 definitely helped
[05/08/2022, 11:42:34] George Sheen: Boracic a key differentiator

[05/08/2022, 12:07:39] George Sheen: but it is worth us all remembering that RISHI and SUNAK are both 5 letters

[05/08/2022, 12:10:44] Joe: It's beautiful
[05/08/2022, 12:12:03] Harvey Williams: Maybe Chris' admiration for Rishi comes from his understanding of word definitions. How could they be deprived if they had funding, someone has to uphold the dictionary.
[05/08/2022, 12:18:30] Tom: Holy shit, do we remember who his opponents second name is? (Supporting structure found on bridges)

[05/08/2022, 15:54:53] Tom: It comes from a niche chemical which I thought it sounded like
[05/08/2022, 15:55:04] Tom: But I've never heard that word used
[05/08/2022, 15:55:32] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: there is a real range of times on the board here

[05/08/2022, 16:34:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I spelled 4 wrong but thankfully noticed that MANEA probably wasn't the word i was looking for
[05/08/2022, 17:10:06] George Sheen: Boracic is short for boracic lint which is some old medical thing that does contain boron
[05/08/2022, 17:10:16] George Sheen: Boracic lint = skint in cockney rhyming slang
[05/08/2022, 17:10:26] George Sheen: Chris just LOVES shafting northerners
[05/08/2022, 17:10:46] George Sheen: I have heard boracic before though, unlike half-inched
[05/08/2022, 17:31:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i have heard half inched

[05/08/2022, 18:00:16] Harvey Williams: I also did this
[06/08/2022, 11:24:52] George Sheen: I loaded the Plusword when I'd drank too much whisky last night and it was too much
[06/08/2022, 11:25:11] George Sheen: reloaded it today hoping for better outcomes but still the board is empty
[06/08/2022, 11:25:50] George Sheen: I can suggest a few answers for them but none that fit other words so far. Dunno if I've got alcohol-induced braindeath or if this is a verified tough one

[06/08/2022, 11:44:58] Joe: I don't get 9a, and hadn't heard of 2d
[06/08/2022, 11:47:38] George Sheen: Yeah same here for both
[06/08/2022, 11:47:45] George Sheen: Did you know the Plusword?
[06/08/2022, 11:48:06] Joe: Like as a word? Yeah
[06/08/2022, 11:50:41] George Sheen: I guess I've heard it before, googling it, but I did resort to trying every phonetically possible letter combination on the keyboard

[06/08/2022, 18:05:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: including the plusword
[06/08/2022, 18:05:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: just staring at it trying to come up with any word for either
[06/08/2022, 18:06:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: glad to see that 9 was literally nonsense

[06/08/2022, 18:15:23] Joe: Yeah 9 is nonsense :( apparently it's a standard connection among cryptic quizzers though
[06/08/2022, 18:16:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: cruel trick to put that in a cross with what i would say is another fairly niche clue
[06/08/2022, 18:16:58] Joe: Yeah true
[06/08/2022, 18:17:14] Joe: It's hard coming up with 5x5 crosswords though, Chris does his best

[07/08/2022, 15:34:32] George Sheen: I've also never heard of 4 and agree that 9 is nonsense, wasted some time because there is a slang word that's similar but it's not that
[07/08/2022, 15:34:48] George Sheen: What the fuck does Chris Lancaster know about slang words for needles anyway?
[07/08/2022, 15:34:59] George Sheen: His Twitter banner is a picture of Rishi Sunak
[07/08/2022, 15:35:33] George Sheen: He's hardly sitting around a fire in a steel bin using his bic to sterilise his mates' needles
[07/08/2022, 15:36:25] George Sheen: I hadn't heard of 7 either, but after Googling it I guess it is right

[08/08/2022, 15:08:20] George Sheen: They were words we didn't know because they're words that aren't worth knowing
[08/08/2022, 15:08:36] George Sheen: I am sharing none of my grey matter whatsoever to learn "osier"
[08/08/2022, 15:08:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: any word I don't know is stupid niche knowledge only known by nonces
[08/08/2022, 15:09:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it's that simple
[08/08/2022, 15:09:02] George Sheen: And if anything am worried that bringing it up again might make me accidentally learn it
[08/08/2022, 15:09:11] George Sheen: Too damn true
[08/08/2022, 15:09:30] George Sheen: Bloody dictionary-bashing turbononces
[08/08/2022, 15:09:53] George Sheen: You'll never be a Countdown octochamp, touch grass you musty old anoraks
[08/08/2022, 15:09:56] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: there's a man who gets it

[09/08/2022, 11:27:15] George Sheen: I wanted to put the emoji in my message but decided to go along with whatsapp web's executive decision to put it in the image instead
[09/08/2022, 11:27:35] George Sheen: CL is taking liberties with some of these nonstandard spellings recently
[09/08/2022, 11:27:48] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so thoughtless
[09/08/2022, 11:28:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I hope you gave them a good telling off
[09/08/2022, 11:30:02] George Sheen: I told him I wasn't going to take the flowers and let him get on with his day until he'd gone through everyone one of these clues with me to make back the time
[09/08/2022, 11:30:17] George Sheen: He was shit though, he just kept saying answers like DAISY and ROSES irrespective of what the clue was

[09/08/2022, 11:35:30] Joe: I thought I had it all wrong for a while, nothing seemed to fit
[09/08/2022, 11:35:48] Joe: Then it just came together
[09/08/2022, 11:35:57] Joe: Never seen that spelling for 4d...
[09/08/2022, 11:36:28] Joe: Everything else I guess I'm fine with... I didn't know what 6a means but it worked out in the end

[09/08/2022, 11:40:03] George Sheen: 6 I knew, it's a good, hearty, noncy word (at least as an adjective). I think 4 is a bit of a travesty
[09/08/2022, 11:40:11] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: ditto 6a
[09/08/2022, 11:40:30] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: very annoyed that somehow I inserted a random letter into 3/6
[09/08/2022, 11:40:44] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: which made the plusword impossible
[09/08/2022, 11:41:36] George Sheen: Good time considering fumbles in the Plusword jungle
[09/08/2022, 11:41:42] George Sheen: They can set a man back years
[09/08/2022, 11:43:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: don't think I could have done a sub minute but a sub two was definitely on the cards had I not fat-fingered a random letter in there

[10/08/2022, 12:18:54] Joe: The middle letter I only got because I had the plusword already... I was sounding out 3d all wrong
[10/08/2022, 12:19:01] Joe: And I don't really know 7a
[10/08/2022, 12:19:40] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: ditto 3d
[10/08/2022, 12:20:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't really understand 2d
[10/08/2022, 12:20:10] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and only now having checked it again do I see what 4d actually is
[10/08/2022, 12:20:18] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I assumed it was just a word I'd never come across
[10/08/2022, 12:20:22] Joe: I also forgot that Chris likes to put two word answers
[10/08/2022, 12:20:30] Joe: I was sounding 4d out as a single word lol
[10/08/2022, 12:20:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: cheeky fucker isn't he
[10/08/2022, 12:20:49] Joe: He knows exactly what he's doing as well
[10/08/2022, 12:21:06] Joe: 2d I don't know either, I had a different but similar word in it for a while
[10/08/2022, 12:21:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 9 I guessed immediately in my first pass through and then removed it because nothing else fit
[10/08/2022, 12:21:26] Joe: Hah nice, I guessed the other similar one for 9
[10/08/2022, 12:21:42] Joe: So it did fit with some other answers for a while
[10/08/2022, 12:22:09] George Sheen: Me too
[10/08/2022, 12:22:24] George Sheen: Which was annoying because 2 and 3 were the two I didn't know
[10/08/2022, 12:22:41] George Sheen: And the intersect with 9 at the key points
[10/08/2022, 12:28:47] Harvey Williams: Hmm
[10/08/2022, 12:28:53] Harvey Williams: This could be going better
[10/08/2022, 12:36:45] Tom: Lol this came through while a consultant was filling something in on my phone

[10/08/2022, 12:37:52] Tom: And it is true

[10/08/2022, 12:39:26] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: does it say next plusword in 00:00
[10/08/2022, 12:39:35] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or forcefully refresh and give you the new one
[10/08/2022, 12:39:51] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or say next plusword available NOW
[10/08/2022, 12:39:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or show a negative time
[10/08/2022, 12:40:05] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or simply roll over to 23:59 again
[10/08/2022, 12:40:18] Tom: Probably crashes the whole game for everyone and the server sets on fire
[10/08/2022, 12:40:23] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: that would be so cool

[10/08/2022, 19:26:22] Harvey Williams: 25 mins is amateur perseverance
[10/08/2022, 19:26:33] Harvey Williams: Never forget my 8 hour plusword
[10/08/2022, 19:31:19] Joe: I remember it
[10/08/2022, 19:31:45] Joe: And I remember your flimsy excuses afterwards. I knew then that you'd been giving it 8 hours of your attention
[10/08/2022, 20:11:19] Harvey Williams: Are we all ready
[10/08/2022, 20:11:22] Harvey Williams: For the holiday
[10/08/2022, 20:11:38] Harvey Williams: And being dragged into mine and Oli's cryptic crossword whirlwind
[10/08/2022, 20:25:20] George Sheen: Haven't you two cracked the cryptic yet?
[10/08/2022, 20:25:28] Harvey Williams: Often
[10/08/2022, 20:25:39] George Sheen: I thought that's why we'd all moved onto Plusword, for something more intellectually stimulating
[10/08/2022, 20:25:43] Harvey Williams: I'd say we are 20% cracked
[10/08/2022, 20:26:10] George Sheen: That's a big claim
[10/08/2022, 20:26:34] George Sheen: We're going to have to make you do at least five a day to take a statistically significant confirmation
[10/08/2022, 20:27:10] Harvey Williams: That's fair

[11/08/2022, 09:33:23] Joe: 2d sorted me out once I had it right
[11/08/2022, 09:33:38] Joe: Blazed through the crossword after that, having put in a few wrong answers before
[11/08/2022, 09:37:12] George Sheen: Me too, I didn't do it very effectively though, it was one of the last I tried

[12/08/2022, 12:31:52] George Sheen: Because I just looked at the timer and realised it took me 12 seconds to get it closed

[14/08/2022, 10:50:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I had no idea what the clue for 7 meant which was annoying
[14/08/2022, 10:52:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think if I was less tired and hungover I might have taken longer on the plusword
[14/08/2022, 10:52:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: because instead of thinking about likely options I was just typing possibilities in and staring at them
[14/08/2022, 10:52:49] Joe: I second guessed 4 so many times
[14/08/2022, 10:53:09] Joe: I also didn't know 7, but I look forward to George getting sub 1 minute due to knowing it instantly
[14/08/2022, 10:53:58] Joe: I got the plusword pretty quickly tbh, haven't we had that one before?
[14/08/2022, 10:54:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: not that I recall
[14/08/2022, 10:54:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I put in 6 immediately and then took it out because it was "wrong"

[14/08/2022, 11:18:18] Harvey Williams: And that Chris has forsaken us again
[14/08/2022, 11:18:21] Joe: I think I know how you mean it's spelled but I'd have spelled it as Chris did

[15/08/2022, 12:40:16] Tom: Wise decision

[15/08/2022, 12:42:26] George Sheen: people getting overly invested and losing their lives to these naff little third person isometric games, clicking furiously around a screen
[15/08/2022, 12:42:44] George Sheen: It's a prejudice but one I'm happy to not challenge

[26/08/2022, 11:04:06] Joe: The fastest times involve furiously typing as soon as letters enter your head
[26/08/2022, 11:04:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: this could have been a sub minute if I hadn't blundered into the wrong answers
[26/08/2022, 11:04:38] Joe: Fair, maybe a minute is too easy a target
[26/08/2022, 11:04:46] Joe: I think 40 seconds is the true barrier to beat
[26/08/2022, 11:06:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: respect the ambition
[26/08/2022, 11:10:27] Joe: We know it can be done
[26/08/2022, 11:12:09] George Sheen: Didn't Oli beat that once? (After I set the 9 second precedent obvs)

[26/08/2022, 11:13:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: was it from before I was in this chat
[26/08/2022, 11:14:18] George Sheen: I imagine it will have been - I did it in 9 seconds once, first try, going in blind, piece of piss
[26/08/2022, 11:14:27] George Sheen: But even that's been beaten by your 0 seconds
[26/08/2022, 11:14:50] George Sheen: So you have every speedrun score to beat, glitch and glitchless
[26/08/2022, 11:15:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 💪💪
[26/08/2022, 11:30:41] Joe: I think that 30 seconds is the true barrier to beat

[26/08/2022, 11:31:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: shifting the goalposts, eh

[26/08/2022, 11:48:51] Joe: I'm assuming it's (-10)^10^10...
[26/08/2022, 11:55:33] George Sheen: I dunno, that's a good point, it felt like a very good time but I've been wrong before
[26/08/2022, 11:56:02] George Sheen: One of those where you can't quite tell if it's so good it's stretched back to the dawn of time or so bad it's lasted until the end of it
[26/08/2022, 15:50:57] Tom: Does the plusword have two L in it

[27/08/2022, 22:03:23] Joe: Think I had the same word in 8 for a bit
[27/08/2022, 22:30:41] Tom: I’ve done it
[27/08/2022, 22:30:46] Tom: Just can’t get the plusword
[27/08/2022, 22:32:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: pay attention to the middle one
[27/08/2022, 22:32:13] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: actually is it the middle one
[27/08/2022, 22:32:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: hold on
[27/08/2022, 22:32:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: yeah 7A gives you a big ol hint
[27/08/2022, 22:33:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i also find it helps to go through what vowels have not been used in the crossword
[27/08/2022, 22:33:25] Joe: I think I missed that hint actually
[27/08/2022, 22:33:33] Joe: I do check vowels though yeah
[27/08/2022, 22:33:53] Tom: Is it or is it not cameo
[27/08/2022, 22:34:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it is not
[27/08/2022, 22:34:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: look at the first and third letter
[27/08/2022, 22:34:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what do you notice about the colours
[27/08/2022, 22:34:59] Joe: The colours Tom
[27/08/2022, 22:35:09] Tom: I’m colour blind
[27/08/2022, 22:35:16] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: doesn't actually matter
[27/08/2022, 22:35:34] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: unless you can't tell white and yellow apart

[27/08/2022, 22:37:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what's this beef w harvey
[27/08/2022, 22:38:42] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what i was trying and evidently failing to hint at is that the same letter is coloured twice
[27/08/2022, 22:38:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so it must appear twice in the plusword
[27/08/2022, 22:39:01] Tom: Yeah don’t worry I got that
[27/08/2022, 22:39:06] Tom: It was a very good hunt

[27/08/2022, 22:40:09] Joe: Harvey once refused to permit Sarah to this chat unless she submitted a plusword time
[27/08/2022, 22:40:17] Joe: Rightly so, in my view
[27/08/2022, 22:40:42] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: he only added me once i had sent him a plusword time
[27/08/2022, 22:40:44] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: that's just the rules
[27/08/2022, 22:46:40] Joe: If Sarah did it though then she would lose her platform for beefing
[27/08/2022, 22:47:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: ah

[29/08/2022, 17:28:49] George Sheen: There is a five letter word which means that clue and it is not that
[29/08/2022, 17:51:12] Joe: Yeah that did make it far worse than it would've been otherwise
‎[30/08/2022, 11:14:59] Joe: ‎<attached: 00002613-PHOTO-2022-08-30-11-14-59.jpg>
[30/08/2022, 11:15:04] Joe: A pretty straightforward one
[30/08/2022, 11:15:35] Joe: Of course made less simple by the fact that I just stuck in the first 5 letter country + drink that I could think of, resulting in some corrections

[30/08/2022, 17:12:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I actually got that pretty much immediately

[31/08/2022, 14:12:10] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: nice
[31/08/2022, 14:12:53] George Sheen: I was
[31/08/2022, 14:13:07] George Sheen: Decided U was most likely but was convinced it was coming before the R
[31/08/2022, 14:13:13] Joe: Just need to work on your agility
[31/08/2022, 14:13:23] George Sheen: After a while gave up with U and went with Y
[31/08/2022, 14:13:30] George Sheen: But that was unsurprisingly a non-starter
[31/08/2022, 14:14:11] George Sheen: truthfully last weekend was a trying time for my mind and we are still trying to sew up some cavernous gaps in the grey matter
[31/08/2022, 14:14:41] Harvey Williams: Might I recommend less time watching nonsense cryptic sports and instead watch the true plusword lovers sport rugby?
[31/08/2022, 14:15:19] George Sheen: Oi
[31/08/2022, 14:15:28] George Sheen: If there's one person who knows his hookers from his props in this chat, it's me
[31/08/2022, 14:15:31] George Sheen: Sexual deviant that I am

[01/09/2022, 11:21:45] Joe: I didn't find that easy at all
[01/09/2022, 11:22:03] Joe: Even the plusword I had to get with random letter guessing
[01/09/2022, 11:22:29] Joe: And I was typing too fast, so by the time it registered that I'd entered the right letter I was already way past the solution and had to guess again to find what it was
[01/09/2022, 11:23:14] Joe: Never heard of 1a, I guess the rest are acceptable answers that I could have got a bit faster

[01/09/2022, 11:35:25] Tom: Thanks

[01/09/2022, 11:42:35] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or is that a spoiler for those who haven't done it yet
[01/09/2022, 11:42:39] Tom: Yeah
[01/09/2022, 11:42:57] Tom: It’s probably already a good hint for George
[01/09/2022, 11:48:56] Joe: If George is able to complete today's plusword then we'll know why
[01/09/2022, 11:52:38] Tom: I think he’s trying to sleep

[01/09/2022, 12:00:33] George Sheen: But the plusword took me about 20x less time than SCRUM
[01/09/2022, 12:00:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the way you've all pulled together to make me feel good about my 2 minute time is so kind
[01/09/2022, 12:01:29] George Sheen: Let's drop more hints so hopefully Harvey gets a sub one-minute to put you in your place then
[01/09/2022, 12:01:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I had no idea what 1A was, I was briefly tricked by the tense of 3D, I spelled 6A how the puzzle wanted me to first time
[01/09/2022, 12:01:52] George Sheen: I fucked up the tense on one of the board which added a lot time
[01/09/2022, 12:02:15] George Sheen: My tense confusion was definitely not brief
[01/09/2022, 12:02:21] George Sheen: and yep wtf is 1A
[01/09/2022, 12:02:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I'm not sure how else you spell it but I think that might be the blessing of not knowing a lot about the subject
[01/09/2022, 12:02:53] George Sheen: You spell it like a filthy Yank
[01/09/2022, 12:03:05] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I would guess I spent about 20 30 seconds fucking around with the wrong word in 8 because of the cheeky 3 fuckaroo
[01/09/2022, 12:04:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I also deleted 9 because it didn't feel quite right but it turns out it was the right answer the whole time
[01/09/2022, 12:05:33] George Sheen: 7 took me a while but I blame that on sleep deprivation
[01/09/2022, 12:05:45] George Sheen: Classic noun/verb ambiguity
[01/09/2022, 12:06:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: blessed to have got 7 immediately

[01/09/2022, 12:06:41] George Sheen: I've got tinnitus from being flamboyantly homosexual last weekend
[01/09/2022, 12:06:46] Tom: There’s an o in it that the Americans have decided to drop
[01/09/2022, 12:06:51] Tom: DISGUSTAN
[01/09/2022, 12:07:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I picked that up from context and Google eventually
[01/09/2022, 12:07:15] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: how does being flamboyantly homosexual give one tinnitus
[01/09/2022, 12:08:15] George Sheen: Misapprehension of oral/aural
[01/09/2022, 12:08:17] George Sheen: Easily done
[01/09/2022, 12:08:30] George Sheen: but also terribly loud music at Pride

[02/09/2022, 10:00:22] Joe: Today's plusword may be impossible

[02/09/2022, 10:10:51] Joe: I reckon without that I could have had a fine performance
[02/09/2022, 14:10:44] George Sheen: luuuuuurve this hype generation
[02/09/2022, 14:10:48] George Sheen: lesssssgoooo
[02/09/2022, 14:12:32] George Sheen: okay can confirm no-one is getting sub one-minute
[02/09/2022, 14:14:42] Joe: To be clear, when I said the plusword may be impossible I meant the whole thing, not the final wordle bit
[02/09/2022, 14:18:43] George Sheen: Hah I know, I finished the final Plusword before the rest of the board

[02/09/2022, 14:39:01] Joe: I agree with this, but would add that all the others are horseshit too except maybe 9a
[02/09/2022, 14:40:33] George Sheen: You guys need to spend more time with your head up your own backsides like me if you don't know 2D
[02/09/2022, 14:40:45] George Sheen: There's ground for Tom to make back on that one because it took me a bit
[02/09/2022, 14:41:11] George Sheen: Not because he is a med student, but because his chief place of residence is right up there
[02/09/2022, 14:41:40] George Sheen: I'll also argue about 1A and 6A

[02/09/2022, 14:44:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: isn't 2D a planet in mass effect

[02/09/2022, 14:45:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: do you mean other than the answer
[02/09/2022, 14:46:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or other than my superior allegedly "incorrect" answer
[02/09/2022, 14:50:13] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: is a "schoolfellow" a thing
[02/09/2022, 14:50:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: wrong chat

[02/09/2022, 15:10:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I wouldn't have thought the actual answer is a soup either

[02/09/2022, 15:13:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I want some soup
[02/09/2022, 15:13:55] George Sheen: He needs to learn the difference between a countable and uncountable noun
[02/09/2022, 15:13:56] Joe: I'm just going to get a tube of soup from Tesco
[02/09/2022, 15:14:03] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I want some soup and some crusty bread
[02/09/2022, 15:14:08] George Sheen: The answer means the clue only if it's uncountable
[02/09/2022, 15:14:19] George Sheen: You can't make it countable
[02/09/2022, 15:14:30] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: he's pulled this shit before
[02/09/2022, 15:14:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and it's always in dictionaries
[02/09/2022, 15:14:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: look up 1D and see what the plural is
[02/09/2022, 15:14:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: because it's what he's got

[02/09/2022, 15:15:52] Joe: He goes just far enough to piss everyone off, without actually having anything he can be professionally held accountable for
[02/09/2022, 15:16:47] George Sheen: Hate it
[02/09/2022, 15:16:58] George Sheen: I don't know if I can form a sentence with it being plural
[02/09/2022, 15:17:07] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I had this exact reaction with a plural a week or two ago
[02/09/2022, 15:17:23] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: angrily typing it into Google and even more angrily reading that his plural was technically correct
[02/09/2022, 15:17:31] George Sheen: And to choice a noun that has born countable and uncountable meanings the synonym is worthy of trial by combat
[02/09/2022, 15:17:34] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't recall what
[02/09/2022, 15:17:48] Joe: "Did you see those vain and ostentatious displays last night?"
[02/09/2022, 15:18:19] Joe: Chris doesn't get nearly enough abuse on twitter
[02/09/2022, 15:18:43] George Sheen: But you'd say "Did you see the [x] last night?"
[02/09/2022, 15:18:47] George Sheen: And if it took multiple forms
[02/09/2022, 15:19:00] George Sheen: "Did you see all the different kinds of x last night?"
[02/09/2022, 15:19:06] George Sheen: He doesn't

[02/09/2022, 17:08:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: try hitting the keys harder
[02/09/2022, 17:08:22] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: that ought to do it
[02/09/2022, 17:09:10] Tom: I hope it will next time

[03/09/2022, 20:30:34] Joe: Yeah today's was particularly egregious
[03/09/2022, 20:30:55] Joe: I didn't want to call out 1a as well in case it's too close to a spoiler, but they've had enough time

[05/09/2022, 12:05:18] George Sheen: I got 3D wrong initially and that added on a good 30 seconds
[05/09/2022, 12:05:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: none of my mistakes were too costly because they were all cancelled out by the definites fairly quickly

[05/09/2022, 12:31:46] George Sheen: Please try and do better than me next time so you can finally earn my respect for a day
[05/09/2022, 12:32:11] George Sheen: The thing I put in is a word but has absolutely nothing to do with governments or whatever the clue was about
[05/09/2022, 12:32:26] George Sheen: I'm think it's an alliance in something fictional but I have no idea what
[05/09/2022, 12:32:43] George Sheen: I've checked Metal Gear Solid and Marvel and it's not either of those
[05/09/2022, 12:33:00] George Sheen: The actual answer could well have been out of those too though
[05/09/2022, 12:33:35] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what was it
[05/09/2022, 12:35:38] George Sheen: SABRE
[05/09/2022, 12:35:54] George Sheen: If that's not already a committee then I'm founding it now
[05/09/2022, 12:36:22] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it absolutely sounds like MGS or marvel

[05/09/2022, 12:47:42] George Sheen: That is to say, the one you could most personally bring the most improvement to using your insight of what makes a great road
[05/09/2022, 12:48:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: alcester road by the lidl

[05/09/2022, 12:53:26] George Sheen: That's the type of shit they spend millions getting animated as visions of utopia in sci-fi films like Black Panther
[05/09/2022, 12:53:31] George Sheen: A vision of a brighter future
[05/09/2022, 12:54:00] George Sheen: Also, I didn't realise there was a Hollywood in Birmingham
[05/09/2022, 12:54:11] George Sheen: Have they got a pastiche sign on a hill?
[05/09/2022, 12:54:28] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: they have not
[05/09/2022, 12:54:40] George Sheen: Good

[05/09/2022, 12:57:13] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: had to put Bolognese sauce in my tea instead of milk
[05/09/2022, 12:57:24] George Sheen: Italians coming over in their droves to get a taste of what real spaghetti is like

[05/09/2022, 14:04:47] Joe: Well he probably still feels that he is ready for Rishi
[05/09/2022, 14:04:59] Joe: But clearly he was not ready for Lizi

[06/09/2022, 11:19:43] Joe: Since it's a yellow letter
[06/09/2022, 11:19:55] Joe: I just guessed based on something that I thought was vaguely similar
[06/09/2022, 11:20:47] Joe: Oh actually no I misread the clue for 3d lol, so it was pure luck that got me it

[06/09/2022, 22:29:37] Harvey Williams: I did the plusword
[06/09/2022, 22:29:42] Harvey Williams: Then went into guessing mode
[06/09/2022, 22:29:51] Harvey Williams: Imagined what might be a word
[06/09/2022, 22:30:07] Harvey Williams: And using the wordle bits to make them
[06/09/2022, 22:30:15] Harvey Williams: Like if it's coloured it's in the plusword
[06/09/2022, 22:30:19] Harvey Williams: If it's not then it's not

[06/09/2022, 23:03:10] George Sheen: If you don't know 3 then you haven't been voraciously learning every shitty word Chris "Rishi Sunak" Lancaster has been feeding you (although he did use it differently the first itme)
[06/09/2022, 23:04:14] George Sheen: When he first used it was the first time I'd heard it, although I have heard it in another context between him shoehorning it into two Pluswords for its unique letter ordering

[06/09/2022, 23:46:12] George Sheen: Tell people you're never going to learn it to decrease the chances they will
[06/09/2022, 23:46:34] Joe: I'd heard of keening but I didn't put it in until I had a few letters, and not with much confidence
[06/09/2022, 23:46:38] George Sheen: Like assuring everyone you're not going to revise for the exam but then spending 2 weeks with your head in the books learning it all
[06/09/2022, 23:47:02] Joe: Is that what you used to do?
[06/09/2022, 23:47:34] George Sheen: Keening doesn't soun very griefy
[06/09/2022, 23:47:40] George Sheen: Keen beans are rarely in mourning
[06/09/2022, 23:48:34] George Sheen: Only for exams when you're graded against others

[06/09/2022, 23:56:59] Joe: It is a better way to be
[06/09/2022, 23:57:37] Joe: You can learn of the big news that eventually makes it into cryptic clues
[06/09/2022, 23:58:07] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i get my world news from the tone of CL's clues

[07/09/2022, 11:38:19] Harvey Williams: This isn't looking good for me
[07/09/2022, 11:38:24] Harvey Williams: I've stalled big time

[07/09/2022, 13:06:30] George Sheen: I was naive enough to think it was aimed at someone other than himself that time though

[07/09/2022, 13:58:32] George Sheen: I fucked that up big time
[07/09/2022, 13:59:44] George Sheen: I had MECCA as an auto enter 4, looked at the Florida city one for 1A and said "yep, TAMPA fits"
[07/09/2022, 13:59:48] Tom: Not nice one
[07/09/2022, 13:59:59] George Sheen: Took me 4 minutes to realise it had changed to PECCA
[07/09/2022, 14:00:04] Tom: Ahahah
[07/09/2022, 14:00:20] George Sheen: And then I was convinced 3D was AMEND which is where the other half of the time went
[07/09/2022, 14:01:16] George Sheen: Also is anyone else finding they can click "admire completed puzzle" and then proceed to change the letters on the completed puzzle?
[07/09/2022, 14:01:26] George Sheen: If you change them back to the right letters you get a well done screen again
[07/09/2022, 14:01:54] George Sheen: Great for harvesting extra rounds of dopamine from completing it but note you WILL get diminishing returns
[07/09/2022, 14:03:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: as far as I know the only way to get back to your time if you foolishly click admire completed puzzle before taking your screencap (or photo of your screen if you're a boomer) is to do that
[07/09/2022, 14:04:33] George Sheen: You can refresh
[07/09/2022, 14:04:40] George Sheen: But I prefer your approach
[07/09/2022, 15:19:41] Joe: Yeah I've been doing that to get back to my "bravo" screen
[07/09/2022, 15:19:54] Joe: Didn't even occur to me to refresh tbh
[07/09/2022, 15:40:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: me neither

[08/09/2022, 11:11:36] George Sheen: Calculated.
[08/09/2022, 11:12:16] George Sheen: Do you reckon you could actually encapsulate this sound in a voicenote?
[08/09/2022, 11:12:37] George Sheen: I am always perplexed about what it might mean when Rocket League cretins use it
[08/09/2022, 11:12:43] George Sheen: Is it like this

[08/09/2022, 11:28:08] George Sheen: I had the board completed in 40 seconds and the Plusword took me three whole minutes oops
[08/09/2022, 11:28:52] George Sheen: I definitely hamfisted it but still a hard word to get so quickly I reckon
[08/09/2022, 11:47:48] Joe: More like this
[08/09/2022, 11:48:08] Joe: Though either could work
[08/09/2022, 11:48:15] Joe: When I type "whew" I am expressing a feeling not a sound
[08/09/2022, 11:48:59] Joe: Yeah I did feel a bit lucky as I basically saw it right away
[08/09/2022, 11:49:05] Joe: You need that daily wordle practice

[08/09/2022, 12:07:02] Joe: Yeah that is close to how I feel when I "whew", but if I were to express that sound through text I'd type "phew"
[08/09/2022, 12:07:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I imagine like the second part of a wolf whistle done by somebody who cannot whistle

[08/09/2022, 12:09:27] Joe: It's pretty hard to whistle like you can't whistle actually

[08/09/2022, 12:12:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: digging out some headphones to surreptitiously listen to these 1 second recording at work
[08/09/2022, 12:13:20] George Sheen: i.e. people who are beating me only because they are sweaty, fat losers who struggle to breathe through all the lipids accumulating in their airways
[08/09/2022, 12:13:45] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the latter part of this is undeniably a whew

[09/09/2022, 11:51:08] George Sheen: plusword is becoming more challenging with each passing day this week

[09/09/2022, 11:54:05] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: if it helps, which I'm sure it doesn't, most of the words were very obvious after I got them

[09/09/2022, 11:58:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: some kind of psychic focus for the entire UK

[09/09/2022, 12:30:57] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: somewhere, possibly m&s, was selling jubilee sandwiches which looked absolutely atrocious
[09/09/2022, 12:31:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think it was ham and egg and it had a whole boiled egg sliced in half and just kind of slapped in there

[09/09/2022, 12:47:40] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: looking forward to seeing what the m&s sandwich lab boys can whip up for the queen's death

[10/09/2022, 23:25:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: didn't think that was a very nice one
[10/09/2022, 23:25:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 3 and 8 were basically guesses i did not know the definitions of at all
[10/09/2022, 23:26:23] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't think I've ever 7 used to describe a person either
[10/09/2022, 23:28:47] George Sheen: Yeah I didn't know 3 either. I've also had a couple of whiskies and when I saw 1A I knew immediately that trying to understand the words would waste a valuable whole minute so saved it till last
[10/09/2022, 23:29:03] George Sheen: I have heard 7 used to describe people though

[10/09/2022, 23:29:17] George Sheen: Also 8 isn't the best clue, it's mostly used to talk about the eyes
[10/09/2022, 23:32:14] George Sheen: It's the only reason I drink it

[13/09/2022, 11:05:37] George Sheen: great job little buddy
[13/09/2022, 11:12:39] Tom: I feel like that one was suited to me 2, 3, 7 and 8 are all words I think I see more than the average person
[13/09/2022, 11:14:29] George Sheen: You're too modest
[13/09/2022, 11:14:49] Tom: This is a well known quality of mine
[13/09/2022, 11:14:52] George Sheen: You're only professing to be better at history, philosophy, computing and chemistry than 99% of all other people
[13/09/2022, 11:15:21] Tom: I’d say 99.9% really
[13/09/2022, 11:18:16] George Sheen: You've sacrificed first-hand experience of the Plusword in favour of these intellectual pursuits, and that is to be commended
[13/09/2022, 11:23:28] Tom: Ahaha I was going to make a joke about the plusword but I didn’t think this chat was the place for it

[13/09/2022, 11:34:43] Tom: Yeah it definitely has
[13/09/2022, 11:34:50] Harvey Williams: I'd say there is sub 1 potential on this one
[13/09/2022, 11:34:59] Harvey Williams: It was mostly a write in
[13/09/2022, 11:35:07] Harvey Williams: Took way too long on 3
[13/09/2022, 11:46:33] Joe: I actually never figured out the 3/8 intersection
[13/09/2022, 11:46:36] Joe: Just guessed letters for it
[13/09/2022, 11:46:59] Harvey Williams: I did that for 1/7

[13/09/2022, 16:26:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I use them to count letters
[13/09/2022, 16:27:42] George Sheen: Toe dexterity like that deserves to take home the trophy
[13/09/2022, 16:28:07] Harvey Williams: Tbh he only has 5 toes across both feet
[13/09/2022, 16:29:15] Harvey Williams: So he has to commit half as much time per toe
[13/09/2022, 16:29:36] George Sheen: Self amputated so noone would realise his sub-40s are rooted in witchcraft
[13/09/2022, 16:30:01] Harvey Williams: One toe per sub 40
[13/09/2022, 16:30:09] Harvey Williams: He's reached a real dilemma now
[13/09/2022, 16:30:27] Harvey Williams: Sacrifice a counting toe and be reduced to counting one in his head or destroy Tom

[14/09/2022, 22:25:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: had a surge of inspiration for 1a
[14/09/2022, 22:25:34] George Sheen: "Don't be a hare you silly cunt"
[14/09/2022, 22:25:37] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: maybe i can do it
[14/09/2022, 22:25:38] George Sheen: uh oh
[14/09/2022, 22:26:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: maybe not
[14/09/2022, 22:26:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: wait
[14/09/2022, 22:26:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what the fuck is the plusword
[14/09/2022, 22:26:53] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: fuck

[14/09/2022, 22:28:13] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: are we waiting on anyone
[14/09/2022, 22:28:13] George Sheen: Was that SPATE?
[14/09/2022, 22:28:16] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: yeah
[14/09/2022, 22:28:24] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: feel like RUSH doesn't describe that very well
[14/09/2022, 22:28:37] George Sheen: Yeah me neither
[14/09/2022, 22:28:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you could have a spate of stabbings (and if CL keeps this up he might) but you couldn't say that's a rush
[14/09/2022, 22:28:52] George Sheen: That was among my LOI, as those in the know say
[14/09/2022, 22:29:23] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i fucked myself by seeing USU and guessing USURY thinking maybe it was some bizarre meaning to do with stock
[14/09/2022, 22:29:25] George Sheen: Yeah I've only heard it in the context of a flood of things
[14/09/2022, 22:29:39] George Sheen: This was also among my LOI
[14/09/2022, 22:29:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: think stock/usual is also suspect
[14/09/2022, 22:29:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: stock is default
[14/09/2022, 22:29:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: not necessarily usual
[14/09/2022, 22:30:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the default configuration could be used by practically nobody
[14/09/2022, 22:30:36] George Sheen: But default can mean usual in some senses
[14/09/2022, 22:30:42] George Sheen: Like someone's stock/default joke
[14/09/2022, 22:30:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: that's a stretch and you know it and CL knows it better
[14/09/2022, 22:31:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: a glint is a reflection, not a reflect
[14/09/2022, 22:31:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: to emote is not to show a feeling that's over the top, necessarily
[14/09/2022, 22:31:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: while i'm at it, elite are maybe "the pick" of a bunch
[14/09/2022, 22:31:57] George Sheen: It can be a verb
[14/09/2022, 22:31:59] George Sheen: Like gleam
[14/09/2022, 22:32:14] George Sheen: This one is dumb but I think it's the third time he's used it
[14/09/2022, 22:33:06] George Sheen: With the same clue each time
[14/09/2022, 22:33:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also had sound in 7A for a little while
[14/09/2022, 22:33:13] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: that's not a complaint, it's just a thing that happened
[14/09/2022, 22:33:25] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: thankfully RADII got me out of that jam pretty quick
[14/09/2022, 22:33:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: congratulations on your best time on the board
[14/09/2022, 22:34:14] George Sheen: Yeah I don't think I would have got it without the little half diameter input
[14/09/2022, 22:34:18] George Sheen: It all came together after that

[14/09/2022, 22:46:26] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: a statue of birmingham's second finest creation

[14/09/2022, 23:06:28] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: look at that smile
[14/09/2022, 23:10:46] George Sheen: That was all you
[14/09/2022, 23:11:10] George Sheen: You worked them each out fractions of a second before reading my messages
[14/09/2022, 23:11:22] George Sheen: It was just too quick for your conscious mind to register
[14/09/2022, 23:11:32] Harvey Williams: Tbf I only saw this one
[14/09/2022, 23:11:56] Harvey Williams: Realised I'd been forgotten and dejectedly attempted to regain recognition with my peers
[14/09/2022, 23:12:02] Tom: This is almost as good as the Marble Arch mound
[14/09/2022, 23:13:05] George Sheen: I failed to recognised you hadn't submitted a time, so you did desperately need some
[14/09/2022, 23:40:55] Joe: I agree with every criticism of today's Lancastrian bullshit
[14/09/2022, 23:41:05] Joe: I also agree with this statue
[14/09/2022, 23:41:10] Joe: Is it intentionally shit?
[14/09/2022, 23:41:18] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: basically  yes

[15/09/2022, 10:55:41] Joe: Only not heard of 8a, but fortunately i got all the verticals as I'm not sure I could have figured out any of the letters for it if I had one missing
[15/09/2022, 10:56:01] Joe: (This can be considered a clue as it rules out "haiku", which was my only consideration before that)
[15/09/2022, 10:56:54] Joe: (But clues of this nature are often given, plus I'm happy to be the only one who completed it without clues anyway)
[15/09/2022, 11:25:24] George Sheen: There would be if I wasn't so dire at Pluswords
[15/09/2022, 11:25:25] George Sheen: ugh
[15/09/2022, 11:25:29] George Sheen: I used to be mediocre at them

[15/09/2022, 22:17:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: disagree
[15/09/2022, 22:17:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: think this is a trick one
[15/09/2022, 22:17:42] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the fuck am i meant to do with nothing but yellow letters

[15/09/2022, 23:13:31] Joe: Maybe she thought you were cheating by closing the tab
[15/09/2022, 23:13:42] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i edited her face to more accurately represent my feelings and i imagine hers

[16/09/2022, 12:49:21] Harvey Williams: Though I guess on pc you see them all at once

[16/09/2022, 13:33:24] Tom: What flavour are we on today
[16/09/2022, 13:33:36] Harvey Williams: Is that a square monitor
[16/09/2022, 13:33:41] Harvey Williams: Is this why you normally zoom in

[16/09/2022, 13:33:55] Tom: …where is the beer?
[16/09/2022, 13:34:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I did it on that one because it's angled so fewer people can see
[16/09/2022, 13:34:18] Tom: I’m impressed though, good flavour choice
[16/09/2022, 13:34:20] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the beer will come later
[16/09/2022, 13:34:42] Joe: Perfect before beer
[16/09/2022, 13:35:24] Harvey Williams: So it's a lack of testosterone that's causing me to falter at plusword
[16/09/2022, 13:35:45] Tom: Time to crack open the steroids boys
[16/09/2022, 13:35:50] Tom: Get those ripped thumbs out

[16/09/2022, 13:38:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it's seen the doors to my office fire escape very, very closely
[16/09/2022, 13:38:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: turns out the space between the handles when closed is just less than a thumbs width
[16/09/2022, 13:39:00] Joe: Did you write about your injury in the H&S incident log?
[16/09/2022, 13:39:11] Harvey Williams: A man's desperate attempt to plusword alone in nature
[16/09/2022, 13:39:30] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I ran it under the tap for 20 seconds so it's fine I reckon
[16/09/2022, 13:39:52] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: not sure why because it wasn't a burn but it seemed the right thing to do
[16/09/2022, 13:46:25] Joe: @Tom can we get confirmation?
[16/09/2022, 13:46:47] Tom: I didn’t want to wade in as I’m not qualified for another 2 years
[16/09/2022, 13:46:55] Tom: But it sounds like it would help
[16/09/2022, 13:47:04] Tom: Depends what was in the tap of course
[16/09/2022, 13:47:18] Joe: Thanks Tom, and good point
[16/09/2022, 13:47:31] Joe: I'd have written an injury of that magnitude in the log in a heartbeat though. I've always liked the idea of it
[16/09/2022, 13:48:11] Tom: Oh yeah you definitely need to hype it up to get time off
[16/09/2022, 13:48:33] Tom: A girl on placement had a fumecupboard windows pop out and land on her foot. Didn’t even hurt her but she got a whole week off
[16/09/2022, 13:48:53] Joe: Trap it in the same doors a week later and ask why they did nothing despite being informed of the risk
[16/09/2022, 13:49:04] Joe: That sounds dreamy, I wish I faced such risks in my job
[16/09/2022, 13:50:39] Tom: There’s always other windows…

[22/09/2022, 11:37:47] Joe: You gave it a good go
[22/09/2022, 11:38:48] George Sheen: I think it would have been on if I had known 1D, 2 or 9
[22/09/2022, 11:39:16] George Sheen: too many knowledge gaps that my A-level in French just could not salvage
[22/09/2022, 11:39:25] Harvey Williams: Classic uglis
[22/09/2022, 11:42:51] Joe: I've heard of the plant but it took some effort to understand the clue... Plant, stare (anag.)
[22/09/2022, 11:43:13] Joe: I was thinking that a word meaning plant/stare was an anagram of the answer
[22/09/2022, 11:43:30] Joe: In hindsight maybe it's obvious but whatever, I still feel CL did me dirty
[22/09/2022, 11:45:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I just missed anag completely in my need for speed

[22/09/2022, 11:45:53] Harvey Williams: Very generous
[22/09/2022, 11:46:52] George Sheen: Yeah I've heard of aster and ugli fruit before, but not in a way that's retrievable in a high intensity situation
[22/09/2022, 11:47:17] George Sheen: I wish I had read this before attempting so I knew the stakes
[22/09/2022, 11:47:34] George Sheen: Because I wasted time doing this; ignoring was the better way to go
[22/09/2022, 11:48:42] George Sheen: STEER goes into the books with SQUAB as a word for a juvenile animal that crossword setters just can't get enough of
[22/09/2022, 12:24:05] Joe: Only steers and queers come from Texas private cowboy
[22/09/2022, 12:25:53] George Sheen: Only squabs and hot, juicy knobs come from Byfleet, private Toby
[22/09/2022, 12:27:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: UGLIS was very much "is that a word? all the horizontals seem right, I guess it must be" for me
[22/09/2022, 12:28:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: JAFFA was one I thought was right but was reluctant to commit to because I wasn't sure if it was spelt differently and I was thinking of delectable cakes
[22/09/2022, 12:29:57] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: ASTER I only got having TER already and realising too late it was an anagram which confirmed my Jaffa suspicions
[22/09/2022, 12:33:45] George Sheen: Yeah it looked right to me, but I was also thinking of that orangey confectionery and the antagonist from Aladdin and was afraid of crossing wires
[22/09/2022, 12:34:10] George Sheen: Arabian scoundrel is right behind controversial cake without failure (5)

[23/09/2022, 10:47:10] Tom: Maybe both?
[23/09/2022, 10:47:12] George Sheen: It's a diffy one I reckon
[23/09/2022, 10:47:15] Harvey Williams: Thought the plusword was kinda chill

[26/09/2022, 16:09:40] Harvey Williams: Foolish of my to store my overflowing grey matter there.
[26/09/2022, 16:10:05] George Sheen: Are you letting your phone's autosuggestions type for you again?
[26/09/2022, 16:10:35] Harvey Williams: I actually have that disabled and I find it limits my creative thought
[26/09/2022, 16:11:05] George Sheen: I agree, the only way I can be creative is if I let a computer tell me what to say
[26/09/2022, 16:11:41] Harvey Williams: These blasted computers
[26/09/2022, 16:11:44] Harvey Williams: Ruining everything
[26/09/2022, 16:12:11] George Sheen: Creativity but also the hostie knew that I have a great time at the end of the day and I will send you a picture of my new address
[26/09/2022, 16:12:29] George Sheen: Did you mean as it limits your creative thought?
[26/09/2022, 16:12:46] George Sheen: Because I read it as your creativity being neutered by the lack of autosuggestions
[26/09/2022, 16:13:13] George Sheen: All I'm saying is that War and Peace would be no worse off if Leo Tolstoy had autosuggestions turned on in Word
[26/09/2022, 16:14:46] Harvey Williams: As with all good art, it's up to your interpretation
[26/09/2022, 16:16:45] George Sheen: Great, I'll see which Google thinks it is
[26/09/2022, 16:42:09] Joe: I don't know how to share my results but I took 133 guesses with 30.83% accuracy and it drove me mad
[26/09/2022, 16:42:15] Joe: I look forward to trying again tomorrow
[26/09/2022, 16:42:55] George Sheen: I think it just takes a few seconds to weirdly change the page before giving you a share option
[26/09/2022, 16:42:58] George Sheen: At least it did for me
[26/09/2022, 16:43:19] Joe: Well for me it never changed the page
[26/09/2022, 16:43:19] George Sheen: It can be very frustrating, you just have to guess that one word that gives you a sniff of it
[26/09/2022, 16:43:34] George Sheen: and I have it on good authority that there are like hundreds of words out there
[26/09/2022, 16:43:51] Joe: So many words...
[26/09/2022, 16:44:01] George Sheen: Maybe I did something then, scrolled to a dusty corner
[26/09/2022, 16:44:09] Joe: And then not knowing if you've already guessed a good word, but it's spelled US way or is plural or whatever
[26/09/2022, 16:44:21] George Sheen: Yeah that too
[26/09/2022, 16:44:40] Joe: I tried turning on the auto-guess plurals option, but then my next guess was "from" and it wasted a guess on "froms" so I instantly turned it off
[26/09/2022, 16:44:40] George Sheen: I find Wikipedia writes in the passive voice a lot so good to put things in the past tense
[26/09/2022, 16:44:58] Joe: Good tip
[26/09/2022, 16:45:00] George Sheen: Hahaha
[26/09/2022, 16:45:05] George Sheen: I didn't even see that option
[26/09/2022, 16:45:17] Joe: You can do it with shift+enter as well

[27/09/2022, 13:39:09] George Sheen: I could have got that in half as many if I'd taken a step back and studied the first line
[27/09/2022, 13:39:35] George Sheen: rip
[27/09/2022, 13:39:47] George Sheen: Just put in OSIER into whichever seems most relevant and build it from there

[27/09/2022, 13:51:09] Harvey Williams: Yeah tough grid
[27/09/2022, 13:52:41] George Sheen: Haven't heard one of the words ever and another I've heard but would never think to retrieve from the dusty favelas of my empty mind
[27/09/2022, 14:00:16] Harvey Williams: Think I'd heard of them all
[27/09/2022, 14:00:25] Harvey Williams: Was 3 one of the ones you retrieved?
[27/09/2022, 14:06:35] George Sheen: Yeah 3 is the one I'd heard before but a shirtless little Brazilian man was holding it hostage in my brain
[27/09/2022, 14:07:00] George Sheen: By elimination the one I hadn't heard before is probably obvious
[27/09/2022, 14:07:23] George Sheen: at least not in that context
[27/09/2022, 14:08:04] George Sheen: and in my defence I'm not finding a dictionary to back up CL's outlandish definition on the first page of Googie
[27/09/2022, 14:09:26] George Sheen: although in CL's defence, I kind of merged the definition of that one with the definition for 3 in my mind and looking at the clue now can see how he's come to that definition
[27/09/2022, 14:09:48] George Sheen: BUT IN MY DEFENCE there's a word that already means that and it doesn't need all those letters which I assume is why his nonsense isn't in a dicky
[27/09/2022, 14:10:15] George Sheen: That's 2:1 in my favour; I win the case; a month in the stocks for CL
[27/09/2022, 14:12:00] George Sheen: All I'm saying is there is no way Oli is going to take that clue lying down

[07/10/2022, 10:55:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think you need the context
[07/10/2022, 10:55:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I need to become some kind of populist leader and engineer another, even more controversial Brexit
[07/10/2022, 10:56:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: then I can get that sweet, sweet chungus £300
[07/10/2022, 10:56:04] George Sheen: Just listened to this and didn't hear him say "vent in electrical" once. This one starts with its strongest card: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbWYObXSj34
[07/10/2022, 10:56:23] George Sheen: I'm glad you've finally got the motivator you need
[07/10/2022, 10:57:00] George Sheen: Where do you go after Brexiting from the EU? Brexiting from Europe as a geographical continent? Brexiting from the world?
[07/10/2022, 10:57:16] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I was thinking either leaving earth or forcibly ejecting wales

[07/10/2022, 10:58:05] George Sheen: Brexcommunicating the Welsh
[07/10/2022, 10:58:22] George Sheen: Could also be enough to get you your £300 big ones
[07/10/2022, 10:58:43] George Sheen: so long as you follow it up with some big chungus sussy imposter rhetoric
[07/10/2022, 10:58:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: finally I can have both 300 big ones and a beach weekend in Birmingham
[07/10/2022, 10:59:24] George Sheen: Rent out a sunseeker to go up and down those world-famous canals
[07/10/2022, 11:00:03] George Sheen: What's that fact? Birmingham has more canals than Venice by some metric
[07/10/2022, 11:00:34] George Sheen: Probably length of water which isn't that impressive given I assume it's much bigger
[07/10/2022, 11:04:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it's more miles, I think
[07/10/2022, 11:04:24] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the canals aren't quite as picturesque
[07/10/2022, 11:04:59] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: but if you're going for raw numbers we got em beat

[07/10/2022, 11:07:26] George Sheen: Whereas I have been to Birmingham and can confirm it smells like hygiene & prosperity
[07/10/2022, 11:07:38] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I was going to say that but I didn't think anyone would believe me

[07/10/2022, 11:09:53] George Sheen: Their blinds are better too
[07/10/2022, 11:10:05] George Sheen: Boarded up windows, more practical for the common man
[07/10/2022, 11:12:58] Harvey Williams: Birmingham Blinds sounds like a shit mix cocktail
[07/10/2022, 11:13:24] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: keep talking shit and I'll show you a Birmingham blind mate
[07/10/2022, 11:17:07] George Sheen: Like a Moscow Mule but with added oculotoxic methylated spirits
[07/10/2022, 11:17:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: every one has a cup of genuine Birmingham canal water

[07/10/2022, 15:56:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i am going to suggest your answer for 3 is wrong because I can think of two answers for 3 and can't think of any others for 8
[07/10/2022, 16:06:58] Joe: I relented and changed an answer to fit, but then had to walk away from it
[07/10/2022, 16:07:01] Harvey Williams: I have two answers for 3 as well
[07/10/2022, 16:07:17] Joe: I will go back when my head is clear
[07/10/2022, 16:10:04] George Sheen: Note the question mark on 6
[07/10/2022, 16:10:17] George Sheen: If that was in a cryptic they wouldn't question mark it
[07/10/2022, 16:10:30] George Sheen: But for the nursery of Plusword babbies, it is necessary
[07/10/2022, 16:15:38] Joe: The question mark caused me great confusion
[07/10/2022, 16:15:51] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't remember what 6 was
[07/10/2022, 16:15:51] Joe: I did not feel babied

[07/10/2022, 16:17:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: helped me fix the tense of 1D at least
[07/10/2022, 16:17:11] George Sheen: You have too
[07/10/2022, 16:17:21] George Sheen: Both 1s are really quite outrageous
[07/10/2022, 16:17:33] George Sheen: He knew he was being scummy when he wrote in those

[07/10/2022, 18:30:00] Joe: I was very stuck until I got 4
[07/10/2022, 18:30:11] Joe: And when I thought of it I knew it fit because of what you said Oli lol
[07/10/2022, 18:31:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: happy to help

[07/10/2022, 19:13:03] George Sheen: It's right
[07/10/2022, 19:13:43] Harvey Williams: 6 makes me think it's not about being shy
[07/10/2022, 19:13:48] Harvey Williams: And it's gonna be wooly or something
[07/10/2022, 19:14:08] George Sheen: Imagine it were the definition in a cryptic
[07/10/2022, 19:14:23] George Sheen: It's not the most common word in the world though
[07/10/2022, 19:14:59] Harvey Williams: Is it a word for sheep
[07/10/2022, 19:15:03] Harvey Williams: Actually
[07/10/2022, 19:15:06] Harvey Williams: Is a word for ram
[07/10/2022, 19:15:10] Harvey Williams: That's kinda sheepish
[07/10/2022, 19:15:37] George Sheen: Nah, it's a word for sheepish

[07/10/2022, 19:20:24] Harvey Williams: 9 is TENET
[07/10/2022, 19:20:31] George Sheen: Taking advantage of the fact he doesn't have to write (5) at the end of the clue like a REAL crossword setter
[07/10/2022, 19:20:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 1a is a classic internet bulking strategy

[07/10/2022, 19:22:36] Harvey Williams: Is 1d (3,2)

[10/10/2022, 18:56:45] George Sheen: No squeezing involved m8
[10/10/2022, 18:56:53] George Sheen: Like throwing a sausage down an empty corridor
[10/10/2022, 18:57:12] George Sheen: I  think that's my first sub-40

[11/10/2022, 13:26:42] Joe: Definitely fast potential there, I wasted time on the plusword + my stubbornness to change an answer that didn't really fit the clue but did fit the board
[11/10/2022, 13:27:20] Joe: Only didn't know 7a but at the same time I sort of do know it, somewhere deep down
[11/10/2022, 13:36:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: as if that isn't 70% of CLs clues

[11/10/2022, 14:03:02] Joe: Oh yeah, that was whack

[11/10/2022, 14:07:16] Joe: I agree he's stretching

[11/10/2022, 15:55:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I was hoping you'd be the one to succeed where I failed
[11/10/2022, 15:55:45] George Sheen: The amount of times I put a letter underneath a yellow one warrants the most capital of punishments
[11/10/2022, 15:56:03] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: to clinch the sub 40 once more
[11/10/2022, 15:56:26] George Sheen: I was feeling pumped

[11/10/2022, 15:56:55] George Sheen: But in my hubris neglected the basic maxims of the Plusword doctrine

[11/10/2022, 16:02:26] Harvey Williams: people's
[11/10/2022, 16:02:34] Harvey Williams: people is plural
[11/10/2022, 16:02:46] Harvey Williams: Either way it's not me
[11/10/2022, 16:03:05] Joe: I'd say this is right
[11/10/2022, 16:03:15] Joe: Tom will be our' champion

[12/10/2022, 12:26:48] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: rather have that than no notice at all
[12/10/2022, 12:49:19] Joe: True, but those shouldn't be the only options
[12/10/2022, 12:53:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: is CL even drafting these or is it just a machine
[12/10/2022, 12:54:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: is CL a real person?
[12/10/2022, 12:54:45] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: surely our little Tory boy would be behind honest British spellings of honest British words
[12/10/2022, 13:22:48] Joe: I wouldn't put it past him to use a machine to generate the grid
[12/10/2022, 13:23:15] Joe: In fact I'd support full automation of plusword generation

[13/10/2022, 00:14:25] Tom: Gotta go btb
[13/10/2022, 00:14:38] Tom: New Guiness record for most plusword done under an hour

[13/10/2022, 10:52:50] Harvey Williams: This is looking like a cheating one
[13/10/2022, 10:53:00] Harvey Williams: I have 9 and 2/3 I think
[13/10/2022, 10:53:10] Harvey Williams: Think it was 2
[13/10/2022, 10:53:11] Joe: Maybe a couple of others I could have come up with, but I didn't come close to doing so
[13/10/2022, 10:54:57] Joe: I've never heard of only one of the answers, but there's a few answers which I had no clue could be described by their clue
[13/10/2022, 11:00:04] Tom: Ahaha brilliant
[13/10/2022, 11:00:16] Tom: Makes me feel a bit better about my time

[13/10/2022, 11:59:12] Tom: I googled the 1a and I’m glad I did

[13/10/2022, 19:34:45] Joe: You probably know at least one of them
[13/10/2022, 19:34:48] George Sheen: it required a lot of slowly and tentatively piecing together and then finished off with guessing letters for one troublesome cell
[13/10/2022, 19:37:57] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i have 9A, i have some words for 2 and 3 but no crossers and any ideas for others contradict those
[13/10/2022, 19:38:15] George Sheen: Also I'm gonna call it, I think 6a is bullshit
[13/10/2022, 19:38:47] George Sheen: 8 is doable and not bullshit
[13/10/2022, 19:39:24] George Sheen: Your instinct with 2 is probably right, it was my second input
[13/10/2022, 19:42:24] Joe: I agreed but Google roughly says it's right, and that's all that CL needs
[13/10/2022, 19:43:01] Joe: It's one of the ones that I called out as knowing of the answer but never before knowing it fit the clue
[13/10/2022, 19:49:08] Joe: I wanted another look at the board, but I didn't want to log back in to my work pc
[13/10/2022, 19:49:17] Joe: So I re-did it, and it still took me 04:32
[13/10/2022, 19:49:47] Joe: Consider that time a stretch goal for anyone who's yet to attempt it

[13/10/2022, 19:53:02] George Sheen: Reconnoitre
[13/10/2022, 19:53:16] George Sheen: Which is like recon, a recky right?

[13/10/2022, 19:55:06] Joe: Yeah Reconnoitres is one of the many things I googled
[13/10/2022, 19:55:23] Joe: And even after googling I didn't get "cases" until I had 4/5 letters

[14/10/2022, 22:41:22] Joe: I think one was bullshit, from what I remember

[14/10/2022, 22:47:53] Joe: I can't remember the clues/answers but nice one
[14/10/2022, 22:48:18] Joe: Have we maxed out at 3 entries today? Harvey and George?
[14/10/2022, 22:48:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: turns out 1D is a business in church stretton
[14/10/2022, 22:48:29] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so i guess if you didn't know that, go fuck yourself

[14/10/2022, 22:49:09] Joe: Oh yeah I'd never heard of "Mr Bun", if it's a local business that's fucked
[14/10/2022, 22:49:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I did eventually guess what it was

[14/10/2022, 22:49:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: but it's a super shitty clue
[14/10/2022, 22:49:48] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: google it, it genuinely is just a local business
[14/10/2022, 22:50:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I assume it must have been on TV or something unless CL has truly lost it
[14/10/2022, 22:53:20] Joe: I "guessed" once I had 4 out of 5 letters
[14/10/2022, 22:53:32] Joe: I'm happy to assume that CL has just lost it
[14/10/2022, 22:54:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it's especially strange (and infuriating) because it is not a niche word you need a niche, presumably local reference to get
[14/10/2022, 22:57:55] Joe: Yeah that's a good point, he could've come up with any clue for that

[18/10/2022, 13:33:12] George Sheen: One of the acrosses requires general knowledge so it depends on how well you know it, not to call you out but I reckon you'll need a letter or two from the verts to get it

[20/10/2022, 09:50:54] George Sheen: Gearing up to do Plusword and I can already tell I'm going to have some clinical brain stiffies to contend with
[20/10/2022, 09:51:29] George Sheen: I mean I just typed in 'plusword' into the Windows search bar so that's not a good start

[20/10/2022, 10:01:45] George Sheen: definitely not an easy one but I think I made it harder than it had to be, waking up from a pharmacologically aided sleep I feel like I'm thinking through jelly
[20/10/2022, 10:06:47] George Sheen: Actually, looking at the board again I'm going to say it's actually a tough one
[20/10/2022, 10:07:04] George Sheen: Rue not your brain stiffies on this one, my children
[20/10/2022, 10:07:09] Joe: 10am plusword is always dangerous
[20/10/2022, 10:07:17] Joe: I certainly am not yet ready
[20/10/2022, 10:08:32] George Sheen: I know, I've got a lot of work to do so wanted to get it out of the way, but sparing my most efficient mental hours for work really is abhorrent behaviour
[20/10/2022, 10:12:17] George Sheen: also I think two of CL's definitions are whack as ever
[20/10/2022, 10:15:36] Joe: Wanting to "get it out of the way" is not the correct approach to Plusword
[20/10/2022, 10:15:41] Joe: You should savour every day
[20/10/2022, 10:17:17] George Sheen: savour every shite clue that in no way defines the required answer
[20/10/2022, 10:17:57] Joe: Precisely

[20/10/2022, 10:41:12] Joe: I never would have attempted it so early in the morning if not for you
[20/10/2022, 10:42:00] Joe: Didn't know 2d, the rest I guess I'm fine with
[20/10/2022, 10:42:36] Joe: Other than the Italian city which clearly should have been ROME
[20/10/2022, 12:24:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: more spicy intel?
[20/10/2022, 12:32:42] Joe: Yes, in that I give away a clue + rule out the answer "ROME"
[20/10/2022, 12:33:01] Joe: I thought it was permissible intel to give away at this early stage
[20/10/2022, 12:33:13] George Sheen: Master of deception
[20/10/2022, 12:43:43] Harvey Williams: This isn't looking good for me
[20/10/2022, 12:44:14] Harvey Williams: I have 6 and 9
[20/10/2022, 12:44:22] Harvey Williams: I think
[20/10/2022, 12:50:13] Tom: Had to give my phone to another consultant and all these messages came through at once

[20/10/2022, 12:51:12] George Sheen: Consult this, cunt: 🖕
[20/10/2022, 12:51:32] Harvey Williams: I remember when PlusWord Gamers was a peaceful chat
[20/10/2022, 12:51:41] Harvey Williams: We used to have order
[20/10/2022, 12:52:03] Tom: Then we let riff raff in
[20/10/2022, 12:52:09] George Sheen: Back when women were hounded out in their droves
[20/10/2022, 13:04:15] Tom: Ok I’ve turned off message previews now so you can sweat in the chat as much as you like
[20/10/2022, 13:04:28] Harvey Williams: :(
[20/10/2022, 13:04:50] Harvey Williams: Guess I'll throw away my three page message complimenting the consultants
[20/10/2022, 13:05:10] Tom: Ahaha I can show them that separately

[20/10/2022, 13:29:50] George Sheen: Hah there was a while when 7 was my only input, I love that shit
[20/10/2022, 13:30:04] George Sheen: Just waiting on Tom for today then
[20/10/2022, 13:31:02] George Sheen: You should shoot for sub minny to bring deep shame upon all the times before you
[20/10/2022, 13:43:44] Joe: Hah I did think of you as I typed it
[20/10/2022, 13:44:00] Tom: Oooh this one looks hard from the times
[20/10/2022, 13:44:03] Tom: I’ll have a go now
[20/10/2022, 13:44:48] Harvey Williams: What do we think the fastest plusword time available is
[20/10/2022, 13:45:07] Harvey Williams: I figure like 5 words = 10 seconds and plusword = 5
[20/10/2022, 13:45:39] Joe: Didn't someone once get 14 seconds when re-doing it?
[20/10/2022, 13:45:50] Joe: I don't think that 15s is achievable in the real world, with reading clues
[20/10/2022, 13:46:27] George Sheen: I think I got like 9 seconds redoing it, you can probably do it even quicker
[20/10/2022, 13:46:37] Tom: Depends if anyone is using performance enhancing drugs
[20/10/2022, 13:46:43] Tom: Maybe that’s the next frontier
[20/10/2022, 13:46:47] George Sheen: But thinking on the first go does unfortunately take up real world time
[20/10/2022, 13:47:00] Harvey Williams: So maybe 4 seconds a word for 25s?
[20/10/2022, 13:47:11] Harvey Williams: What's that study drug called
[20/10/2022, 13:47:21] George Sheen: Weed
[20/10/2022, 13:47:33] Tom: Havingawank
[20/10/2022, 13:47:57] Harvey Williams: I choose to believe that Tom was typing the real thing until you butted in
[20/10/2022, 13:48:03] Tom: Modafinil is the actual answer
[20/10/2022, 13:48:10] Tom: He’s the true engine of chaos
[20/10/2022, 13:48:15] Harvey Williams: He loves his chemistry
[20/10/2022, 13:48:16] Tom: He corrupts me
[20/10/2022, 13:49:06] Joe: Yeah 25s seems achievable
[20/10/2022, 13:49:10] Joe: CL will never let us do it though
[20/10/2022, 13:49:28] Joe: Especially with his popups to subscribe, give cookies, etc
[20/10/2022, 13:49:28] Harvey Williams: So is that the holy grail
[20/10/2022, 13:49:41] Harvey Williams: Sub 40 -> Sub 30 -> Sub 25
[20/10/2022, 13:49:45] George Sheen: It's actually a huge problem
[20/10/2022, 13:49:58] George Sheen: I've been debating whether to start doing it in private browsing each day
[20/10/2022, 13:50:07] Harvey Williams: Don't find them anywhere else on the website, only where CL leaves his greasy trail
[20/10/2022, 13:50:11] George Sheen: Because the you can close the pop ups and the timer doesn't start until you've accepted the tutorial
[20/10/2022, 13:50:26] George Sheen: But yeah there's the new one about the Plusword app
[20/10/2022, 13:50:34] Joe: Ah that's clever
[20/10/2022, 13:50:36] George Sheen: WHY WOULD THE TIMER START WHILST IT'S ON SCREEN???
[20/10/2022, 13:50:56] Joe: Yeah the timer starting just forces us to close the popups asap
[20/10/2022, 13:50:59] George Sheen: Does mean you lose your beautiful time forever though if the window closes...
[20/10/2022, 13:51:00] Joe: I didn't even know that there is an app
[20/10/2022, 13:51:22] George Sheen: I think it's an app, it's a giant pink pop up that takes up the whole screen
[20/10/2022, 13:51:24] Joe: Yeah true, I do like being able to revisit the board to discuss
[20/10/2022, 13:51:28] George Sheen: I never waste seconds reading it
[20/10/2022, 13:51:44] Joe: Yeah I believe I've seen the popup but I also don't waste seconds
[20/10/2022, 13:51:57] Joe: And then the popup is gone until the next day
[20/10/2022, 13:52:05] Joe: It's cruelly designed to scupper sub-25s
[20/10/2022, 13:52:33] Harvey Williams: Anyone tried the app
[20/10/2022, 13:52:55] George Sheen: Nope, I assume it's vkey only
[20/10/2022, 13:53:14] Tom: This one is tricky
[20/10/2022, 13:53:14] George Sheen: And I save more time on pkey than I waste scrambling to close pop ups
[20/10/2022, 13:53:16] Tom: Confirmed

[20/10/2022, 13:53:44] Joe: I like seeing all of the clues at once, which just isn't possible on mobile app or no
[20/10/2022, 13:54:20] Harvey Williams: Maybe someone should post a screenshot of the clues each morning
[20/10/2022, 13:55:07] Joe: I think that would be dipping into cheating
[20/10/2022, 13:56:08] Harvey Williams: How about for a special one off
[20/10/2022, 13:56:30] Harvey Williams: The plusword world cup
[20/10/2022, 13:56:40] Joe: Would we choose a day at random, or pick an easy day?
[20/10/2022, 13:56:57] Joe: Who will volunteer to take and post the screenshot, thus scuppering their chances at the best time?
[20/10/2022, 13:57:08] Harvey Williams: Well it couldn't be me
[20/10/2022, 13:57:23] Harvey Williams: We went field our best squad
[20/10/2022, 13:58:42] Joe: We should re-add our old members
[20/10/2022, 13:59:02] Harvey Williams: I think the only old member was Leah right
[20/10/2022, 13:59:16] Joe: Oh yeah Sarah was never officially in

[21/10/2022, 12:16:36] Harvey Williams: The answer to 7 is not

[21/10/2022, 13:10:18] Joe: I never get a TMD, but I did just pay £4 for a co-op meal deal

[21/10/2022, 13:37:48] Joe: Sadly we don't have any people in the chat who are likely to fit that
[21/10/2022, 13:38:14] Harvey Williams: I liked today's

[21/10/2022, 21:15:30] George Sheen: I tried it in private mode so I wouldn't drown in pop-ups
[21/10/2022, 21:15:38] George Sheen: it was glorious, I don't know if I can go back
[21/10/2022, 21:25:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: nice private one
[21/10/2022, 21:25:45] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i do it in private on my work laptop so that if ever they check there's no trace of my cheeky word games
[21/10/2022, 21:26:44] Harvey Williams: The inside lane
[21/10/2022, 22:04:12] Joe: I do it on work laptop but do it incognitoless
[21/10/2022, 22:04:38] Joe: My main browsing on work laptop is done incognito, but I think a couple of little slack-like things in your history lower suspicion
[21/10/2022, 22:04:56] Joe: They can't object too much to what I will assure them is at most 3 minutes of plusword per day
[21/10/2022, 22:11:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i'm going to email all your longest times straight to your work

[21/10/2022, 22:13:23] Joe: As I remember it
[21/10/2022, 22:23:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: more than "at most 3"
[21/10/2022, 22:23:47] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you'll be sacked in no time
[21/10/2022, 22:27:43] Joe: 😚

[23/10/2022, 20:14:16] George Sheen: incognito'd but then I still got a delayed pop-up after starting from google or firefox or something asking me if i wanted to save some details or some shite ffs
[23/10/2022, 20:14:43] George Sheen: if it isn't the telegraph it's your browser
‎[23/10/2022, 20:51:41] Joe: ‎<attached: 00005068-PHOTO-2022-10-23-20-51-41.jpg>
[23/10/2022, 20:51:49] Joe: plusword slowed me but I was a bit drunk for all ofit
[23/10/2022, 20:52:03] Joe: I was on my tablet, which I assumed would have the same effect as incog
[23/10/2022, 20:52:14] Joe: But instead I had all the popups with no countdown pausing
‎[24/10/2022, 09:58:58] Joe: ‎<attached: 00005072-PHOTO-2022-10-24-09-58-58.jpg>

[24/10/2022, 10:11:31] Joe: Did you try SPORK?
[24/10/2022, 10:12:21] Tom: I did sadly
[24/10/2022, 10:12:27] Tom: Obviously my first choice
[24/10/2022, 10:12:36] Tom: I actually fill it in before I start the grid
[24/10/2022, 10:13:40] Joe: One day it will pay off

[24/10/2022, 10:19:31] Tom: It didn’t feel nice at the time
[24/10/2022, 22:06:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: did the grid in 30 seconds
[24/10/2022, 22:06:38] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: been staring at the plussie for 2 minutes
[24/10/2022, 22:06:53] Joe: You'll get it lad
[24/10/2022, 22:06:55] Joe: It can be done

[24/10/2022, 22:24:49] George Sheen: diffy pluswords are viagra for my brain stiffies
[24/10/2022, 22:24:53] George Sheen: Not looking forward to this one
[24/10/2022, 22:25:04] Tom: Yeah it’s a certified stonker

[24/10/2022, 22:29:47] Joe: Embarrassing
[24/10/2022, 22:30:03] George Sheen: It was, particularly as CRIME was my last input
[24/10/2022, 22:30:22] George Sheen: I was like "surely CREME doesn't mean something illegal?"
[24/10/2022, 22:30:47] George Sheen: I had to get 3D to work it out
[24/10/2022, 22:32:45] Tom: Very nice one
[24/10/2022, 22:33:32] Tom: The board took me like 8 mins
[24/10/2022, 22:33:39] Tom: Tragic
[24/10/2022, 22:35:25] George Sheen: yeah there were a couple to stand in a field and chew the cud over
[24/10/2022, 22:35:35] George Sheen: RUNON took me a while
[24/10/2022, 22:36:07] George Sheen: aside from CL and his classic 3,2 shenanigans can't complain too much about the clues though
‎[25/10/2022, 08:48:09] Tom: ‎<attached: 00005112-PHOTO-2022-10-25-08-48-09.jpg>

[25/10/2022, 10:31:58] Joe: Otherwise today's wasn't bad, though not an easy one
[25/10/2022, 10:32:17] Joe: I expect CL will take it easy on us now that his boy is in office

[25/10/2022, 12:11:00] Harvey Williams: That was a pretty easy one
[25/10/2022, 12:11:36] Harvey Williams: 1d was a little strange for old CL
[25/10/2022, 12:12:50] Joe: Haha yeah it was

[25/10/2022, 12:14:45] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: very annoyingly I got the right answers for 1 and 7 immediately, then removed them because I couldn't think of anything that fit for vertical clues

[25/10/2022, 12:17:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: 3 is a little sus
[25/10/2022, 12:17:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and I don't love 2
[25/10/2022, 12:17:15] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: lots of things which are not 2 are the clue for 2

[25/10/2022, 13:14:15] George Sheen: did that too soon after napping and didn't even notice clue 2
[25/10/2022, 13:14:30] George Sheen: nice ones anyway
[25/10/2022, 14:37:07] George Sheen: You can use uBlock Origin to block individual page elements from popping up in future
[25/10/2022, 14:37:19] George Sheen: Might have to sacrifice a PW run to do some clean-up
[25/10/2022, 14:45:36] Joe: That's good thinking

[26/10/2022, 10:14:25] Joe: I thought verts first since there's at least one that you can answer with certainty
[26/10/2022, 10:14:42] Joe: All the hozzas are less clear
[26/10/2022, 10:15:00] Joe: Except maybe 1a but idk I have issues with that one
[26/10/2022, 10:23:02] George Sheen: Yeah I see your issue with 1A hozza but that is the one I would have put in without letters
[26/10/2022, 10:23:30] George Sheen: CL considers definitions to be more of a game of word association than what's written in the dictionary
[26/10/2022, 10:58:30] Joe: CL is a menace who will get his comeuppance one day soon

[27/10/2022, 21:13:47] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: my best guess is that somewhere in the hundreds of tabs is a single instance of plusword which loaded up and dutifully started a timer when i opened firefox
[27/10/2022, 21:14:02] Harvey Williams: 2 mins 27s not bad
[27/10/2022, 21:14:28] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: we may never know how long I truly took

[27/10/2022, 21:20:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: let this be a cautionary tale to all tab hoarders
[27/10/2022, 21:20:11] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: a plusword might be ticking away like a bomb

[28/10/2022, 11:42:18] Joe: Could've happened easily since the plusword takes the piss
[28/10/2022, 11:43:16] Joe: Good board today though
[28/10/2022, 11:44:46] Joe: Could've done it faster had I not put in an incorrect guess for 9a doing the hozzas first. Which coincidentally is the worst answer on the board...

[29/10/2022, 00:08:01] Tom: Also very low brow, I’m sorry
[29/10/2022, 00:09:15] Harvey Williams: I laughed at it

[31/10/2022, 16:07:57] Tom: Check it then bitch
[31/10/2022, 16:08:15] George Sheen: Really I think we all need to take pictures of our screens with the flash on like Oli, so the specular highlights can be forensically analysed to check it is unique

[01/11/2022, 14:28:32] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: all the better
[01/11/2022, 14:28:48] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: much lower chance of interruption if you sub30 it
[01/11/2022, 14:30:37] Joe: That seems true, but I reckon that if I'm on track for a sub-30 then people are more likely to approach me
[01/11/2022, 14:58:45] George Sheen: Cheering you on like you're Billy Walker smashing Pac-man high scores (but there the similarities end - you're much more honest when you cheat)

[01/11/2022, 15:03:50] George Sheen: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5lSWM7YsLr5GWd4Htj0f06Q/billy-mitchell Although maybe I meant this one
[01/11/2022, 15:15:44] Joe: I wish
[01/11/2022, 15:16:02] Joe: How does he do that? Doesn't it take years to brew that shite?
[01/11/2022, 15:16:10] Joe: Does he add chems to make it tasty?
[01/11/2022, 15:16:36] George Sheen: A very insightful question, young one
[01/11/2022, 15:16:43] George Sheen: It's mostly in cask management
[01/11/2022, 15:17:05] Tom: Probably just msg and sugar right?
[01/11/2022, 15:17:17] George Sheen: He's got the hook ups and the know-how how to make whisky great by aging it in quality, active casks
[01/11/2022, 15:17:37] Joe: If that's all it takes then why doesn't everybody do it
[01/11/2022, 15:18:16] George Sheen: He will also have changed the distilling process but that will take years to be realised. So as good as Glenallachie is now it'll be even better when the whisky distilled under his watchful eye eventually gets to market
[01/11/2022, 15:18:31] George Sheen: Good casks are hard to come by
[01/11/2022, 15:19:04] George Sheen: You need to be in bed with the right bourbon distillers or sherry makers to get their juicy wood
[01/11/2022, 15:19:22] George Sheen: Or the right coopers making virgin casks from the best oaks
[01/11/2022, 15:20:01] George Sheen: Then there's the aging process itself, knowing when to take it out of certain casks and move it into others, understanding how best to keep the warehouses for optimal aging, whatever
[01/11/2022, 15:22:36] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: one of those things where there are an intimidating number of variables
[01/11/2022, 15:22:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I for one am happy to let someone else think about that
[01/11/2022, 15:23:22] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and I will buy and drink their expertise
[01/11/2022, 15:30:51] George Sheen: Yeah definitely, variables like humidity and temperature make a huge difference and that must be hard to control. You can see that when you taste something like an Indian single malt, it's got a similar production process to Scotch except it's typically  much younger (hotter climate speeds up some aspects of the aging process) and yet it tastes distinctly different
[01/11/2022, 15:31:42] George Sheen: Must take a lot of experience to know how to respond to whims in the climate, including how to blend casks afterwards to try to retain a signature taste
[01/11/2022, 15:31:55] George Sheen: This is the way
[01/11/2022, 15:33:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I'm sure it would be a lovely fun experiment if it didn't take 10 years and a significant amount of money per go
[01/11/2022, 15:33:28] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: someone with too much money should invest in the grandest experiment of all
[01/11/2022, 15:56:32] George Sheen: This is why gin is so popular nowadays, the impatience of a defunct generation. Millennials actually want to be paid for something when they start doing it rather than waiting 10 years for returns 🙄 Makes me sick
[01/11/2022, 16:06:32] Joe: Is this chat still giving me hints for today's plusword? Or have I been reading it all for nothing?
[01/11/2022, 16:07:19] George Sheen: Hints is putting it lightly
[01/11/2022, 16:07:27] George Sheen: Man's been out here spitting pure answers
[01/11/2022, 16:07:52] Joe: Good, because otherwise "for nothing" was putting it lightly

[01/11/2022, 18:14:16] Tom: It’d be a worthy investment
[01/11/2022, 18:14:23] Tom: Shame about the other people on the course though

[01/11/2022, 18:22:58] Tom: It involves a lot of factorio
[01/11/2022, 18:23:12] Tom: There’s a lot of crossover that you wouldn’t be able to grasp until you’re on the course

[02/11/2022, 09:48:20] George Sheen: No sympathy; you brought it on yourself by attempting before 10am.
[02/11/2022, 09:48:37] George Sheen: What brought on the insatiable eagerness to PW this morning?
[02/11/2022, 09:49:35] Joe: I'm already bored of work+reddit so I had no choice

[02/11/2022, 10:31:14] George Sheen: That has to contravene at least one of the Xceptor values
[02/11/2022, 10:39:11] Joe: I don't think that they are required to stimulate me

[02/11/2022, 10:42:56] Tom: Is there anything more cringe than a corporations ‘values’
[02/11/2022, 10:43:20] Tom: Or we are Xceptional

[02/11/2022, 13:55:42] Harvey Williams: Not yet but when I start putting up the plusword banners in the plusword room I'm sure they'll clock on

[04/11/2022, 11:33:40] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think George should run a seminar so we're all on the same page
[04/11/2022, 11:33:44] Tom: I wasn’t aware that plusword is like wordle
[04/11/2022, 11:33:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what
[04/11/2022, 11:33:58] Tom: In that if the letters are white they’re not in the plusword
[04/11/2022, 11:34:04] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: oh my god
[04/11/2022, 11:34:12] Tom: I thought they just chose certain letters to highlight
[04/11/2022, 11:34:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what did you think the colours meant
[04/11/2022, 11:34:38] Tom: The coloured ones were fine
[04/11/2022, 11:35:45] George Sheen: And so there was a possibility that something could be in the Plusword but not highlighted on the board accordingly
[04/11/2022, 11:36:16] George Sheen: A definite disadvantage for ones with head-scratching Pluswords
[04/11/2022, 11:36:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: ok
[04/11/2022, 11:37:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: still think we should have a seminar

[04/11/2022, 11:40:06] George Sheen: Can we get Plusword t-shirts for the party?
[04/11/2022, 11:40:23] George Sheen: From my reading it looks like it's in line with the dress code so long as we wear black ties with them
[04/11/2022, 11:41:02] George Sheen: Otherwise how else is Oli supposed to recognise a fellow Plusworder? Unless we like you know, introduce each other, but thankfully that awful habit is dying out with the boomers
[04/11/2022, 11:41:26] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I can smell a puzzler from 200 paces

[04/11/2022, 11:41:32] Tom: I’d hope he could tell from our massive heads
[04/11/2022, 11:41:44] Tom: 4x larger than the average man
[04/11/2022, 11:42:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: how hard is it to apply a prosthetic for a megamind style super head
[04/11/2022, 11:42:25] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: asking for a friend
[04/11/2022, 11:43:05] George Sheen: Stop enabling the normies to reach our gigantic cranial dimensions
[04/11/2022, 11:43:27] George Sheen: This mass above my shoulders was earned through hard graft
[04/11/2022, 11:47:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what would a plusword t shirt look like
[04/11/2022, 11:48:05] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I HEART Plusword?
[04/11/2022, 11:48:19] George Sheen: Plusword's lady's delighted face blown up on the front
[04/11/2022, 11:48:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: heart being the requisite 5 letters
[04/11/2022, 11:48:35] George Sheen: Her doctored angry face blown up on the back
[04/11/2022, 11:48:45] George Sheen: I like this too, very cerebral
[04/11/2022, 11:49:13] George Sheen: Having such a thing on our torsos can only inflate our cerebra further
[04/11/2022, 11:50:07] George Sheen: Wouldn't want to overshadow Lyd's day when people are struggling to navigate and having to sidle around our giant skulls indoors though

[04/11/2022, 12:37:08] George Sheen: actually wait, we'll have to beat around it slightly longer

[04/11/2022, 12:44:36] George Sheen: another skill to hone to get those record breaking scores
[04/11/2022, 12:47:37] Joe: Now that we're here I'm not comfortable with this
[04/11/2022, 12:47:56] Joe: Assuming that's a copy of today's plusword
[04/11/2022, 12:48:04] Joe: If you've made your own then I wholly support it
[04/11/2022, 12:48:10] Harvey Williams: It's his own

[08/11/2022, 10:53:05] Joe: I was going to say that I got lucky with the plusword, because I thought I'd just entered a random onomatopoeic non-word. But on reflection it's a normal word and I just wasn't reading it right
[08/11/2022, 10:53:20] Joe: Maybe I did get lucky with it still though

[08/11/2022, 11:10:03] Joe: Maybe it is a bit of a hint... I don't think it would help me to get it though
[08/11/2022, 11:10:16] Joe: And I do like giving some crumbs to Oli
[08/11/2022, 11:23:33] George Sheen: high score motherfuckers

[08/11/2022, 11:24:12] George Sheen: there is a moron trap and I fell for it
[08/11/2022, 11:24:28] Tom: To the surprise of no one
[08/11/2022, 11:24:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I'm going to dive straight into the moron trap
[08/11/2022, 11:25:55] George Sheen: harvey standing naked, arms akimbo, on top of a tall structure with the spiciest nice one so far
[08/11/2022, 11:26:45] Joe: I may have fallen for the same moron trap
[08/11/2022, 11:26:51] Joe: 7a?
[08/11/2022, 11:27:33] George Sheen: i don't want to stop staring at harvey's powerful naked body so I couldn't possibly say
[08/11/2022, 11:27:47] George Sheen: he's watching
[08/11/2022, 11:29:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I will address the plusword shortly

[08/11/2022, 11:32:44] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you besmirch my honour sir
[08/11/2022, 11:34:02] George Sheen: So far it's been a case of the early bird gets the worm
[08/11/2022, 11:34:19] George Sheen: You're fighting the tides of time by thinking you'll do any better than dead last
[08/11/2022, 11:34:38] George Sheen: I wonder if there's even any point submitting a time with odds like these

[08/11/2022, 11:36:52] Harvey Williams: My naked body has power beyond my comprehension
[08/11/2022, 11:37:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I suppose
[08/11/2022, 11:37:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I should be thankful it waited until the end of the teams thing I was on
[08/11/2022, 11:38:29] George Sheen: It's a lightning rod for the internet waves all the way on top of your obelisk
[08/11/2022, 11:43:47] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it's over

[08/11/2022, 11:47:47] George Sheen: Left wondering if RANDO was another word for randy and if that qualifies as a positive attitude
[08/11/2022, 11:47:55] George Sheen: Well done the Larv
[08/11/2022, 11:48:07] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i think the pressure got to me
[08/11/2022, 11:48:09] Harvey Williams: Thanks
[08/11/2022, 11:48:21] George Sheen: And very disappointed you bucked the trend of the times increasing as the day drew on, Oli
[08/11/2022, 11:48:22] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the whole world watching and I choked
[08/11/2022, 11:48:28] Harvey Williams: Top marks to Joe for doing instead of doing
[08/11/2022, 11:48:36] George Sheen: I was so stumped by going for the CL tried and tested ADIEU
[08/11/2022, 11:48:49] Harvey Williams: I just skipped it on seeing it
[08/11/2022, 11:48:54] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I'm always team ADIOS
[08/11/2022, 11:48:54] George Sheen: Thought with times so good there has to be some predictable shit from CL
[08/11/2022, 11:49:14] Harvey Williams: Metagamed yourself
[08/11/2022, 11:53:42] Joe: I put in adieu, and had the first downs confirm that I was correct
[08/11/2022, 11:53:52] Joe: A cruel joke from CL
[08/11/2022, 11:54:00] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what the fuck is a lisle
[08/11/2022, 11:54:13] Joe: As was the doing/doing situation
[08/11/2022, 11:54:37] Joe: Lisle I've never heard of... I put in linen and called it a day
[08/11/2022, 11:54:47] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: did anyone know that or was it just a getting scalp and calling it a day thing
[08/11/2022, 11:57:02] George Sheen: I neither have heard nor could begin to guess how you pronounce lisle
[08/11/2022, 11:58:35] George Sheen: For me it was getting IDOLS and calling it a day
[08/11/2022, 11:58:55] George Sheen: Because in my ADIEU -fuelled panic I read the clue as places of worship
[08/11/2022, 11:58:57] Harvey Williams: I presume it's like l isle
[08/11/2022, 11:59:44] George Sheen: This was my thought too, I told a vicious lie when I said I couldn't begin to guess
[08/11/2022, 11:59:58] George Sheen: But I have no faith that is where the pronunciation journey ends
[08/11/2022, 12:00:45] Tom: Ahahah I had that briefly
[08/11/2022, 12:00:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I can tell you that the lisle in de lisle is pronounced like that
[08/11/2022, 12:00:50] Tom: He snaked us
[08/11/2022, 12:01:01] George Sheen: (it is)
[08/11/2022, 12:01:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: now I'm revisiting it I'm just mad I didn't get scalp
[08/11/2022, 12:02:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: my brain came up with "flips" and "profiteering" and then assumed I'd make a mistake elsewhere
[08/11/2022, 12:02:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: regardless, nice ones all
[08/11/2022, 12:05:35] Joe: Yes nice ones all, and an extra special nice one to today's champ Harvey H-Dawg Williams

[09/11/2022, 10:38:48] Harvey Williams: No for my attempt
[09/11/2022, 10:38:54] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: or you're an early bird and the worm is eluding you

[09/11/2022, 10:39:10] Harvey Williams: Maybe 6
[09/11/2022, 10:39:27] Tom: I had a look last night and it looked terrible
[09/11/2022, 10:42:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I'll look at lunch

[09/11/2022, 10:59:26] Harvey Williams: But the one I had wrong was rather annoying
[09/11/2022, 10:59:26] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: bravo!
[09/11/2022, 11:00:31] Harvey Williams: Classic CL in the end
[09/11/2022, 12:09:32] Joe: Big time
[09/11/2022, 12:09:47] Joe: I can't do it until this evening, in case you're hoping to wait for hints Oli
[09/11/2022, 12:10:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't like this reputation I've acquired as a hint sniffer

[09/11/2022, 12:13:42] Joe: We all snort hints really, I'm glad that you're here to take the blame for it
[09/11/2022, 12:13:57] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: at least I've always been open about my hint use
[09/11/2022, 12:14:08] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: decriminalise hints
[09/11/2022, 12:14:37] Joe: You should start indicating your use of hints on your "bravo" screenshots
[09/11/2022, 12:14:53] Joe: I like hints particularly because they so rarely help me with anything
[09/11/2022, 12:15:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't need hints
[09/11/2022, 12:15:51] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I'll show you all
[09/11/2022, 15:04:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: turns out I needed hints

[09/11/2022, 15:06:20] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: to be clear I did not do it at lunch

[09/11/2022, 15:43:00] Joe: I'm feeling confident with these very beatable times...
[09/11/2022, 16:20:49] George Sheen: I'll drink my piss if you get it in under 2 minutes (first time and without cheating)
[09/11/2022, 16:25:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you have everything to play for
[09/11/2022, 17:02:58] Joe: The stakes are high
[09/11/2022, 17:03:04] Joe: But will George really drink his piss
[09/11/2022, 17:03:21] Joe: Maybe 1 drop diluted in 1L of whiskey
[09/11/2022, 17:03:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: George is a man of honour and integrity
[09/11/2022, 17:03:38] Joe: He's also a slippery character though
[09/11/2022, 17:09:57] George Sheen: I've done it before m8
[09/11/2022, 17:10:11] George Sheen: Clearly you never got your Duke of Edinburgh silver award
[09/11/2022, 17:10:23] George Sheen: That's the kind of survival situations they put you in
[09/11/2022, 17:10:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I dread to think what a diet of pure mackerel does to a man's piss
[09/11/2022, 17:11:14] George Sheen: Very oily mouthfeel
[09/11/2022, 17:28:22] Joe: Are you going to shot a few ml of it mixed with sugar free squash?
[09/11/2022, 17:28:35] George Sheen: No, bevaise upi
[09/11/2022, 17:28:44] George Sheen: I rest my case.
[09/11/2022, 17:28:57] George Sheen: But also no, because you're not getting this in under 2 minutes
[09/11/2022, 17:29:19] Joe: Ecosia and I have no idea what this means
[09/11/2022, 17:29:29] Joe: I've spent the day preparing
[09/11/2022, 17:30:19] George Sheen: I hope you've been reading your book of obscure ichthology
[09/11/2022, 17:30:23] George Sheen: otherwise you'll never do it
[09/11/2022, 17:30:33] Joe: Also I'm still accepting hints... Can I assume that there are no clues misleadingly pointing to ENNUI, ADIEU, or any other CL classics
[09/11/2022, 17:30:47] Joe: Thank you for the hint, I will now Google what that is
[09/11/2022, 17:31:16] Joe: Eugh, fish, I hate fish
[09/11/2022, 17:31:25] Joe: Evolve yourselves out of the ocean you lazy bastards
[09/11/2022, 17:31:38] George Sheen: You somehow found it despite my misspelling red herring
[09/11/2022, 17:32:00] Joe: Ecosia steered me right
[09/11/2022, 17:32:02] George Sheen: Facts
[09/11/2022, 17:32:14] George Sheen: They really come to life when you put them on land
[09/11/2022, 17:32:21] George Sheen: All flapping about full of beans
[09/11/2022, 17:32:57] Joe: I watched a video about seahorses this morning, they are the only ocean life I care about
[09/11/2022, 17:33:16] Joe: I can't expect them to make it to land, not when they have regular horses to compete with
[09/11/2022, 17:33:55] George Sheen: Did you see the way the males fire offspring out of their hole like they're mowing down Charlie in the jungles around Hanoi?
[09/11/2022, 17:34:00] George Sheen: Very impressive creatures
[09/11/2022, 17:34:17] George Sheen: This is how men do pregnancy. Take note, females
[09/11/2022, 17:36:10] George Sheen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_nEA3dtOZs
[09/11/2022, 17:36:23] George Sheen: love the burst firing technique
[09/11/2022, 17:36:33] George Sheen: keeping that target reticle pinpoint
[09/11/2022, 17:40:43] Joe: It wasn't shown in my video, but I will never not watch such action given the opportunity
[09/11/2022, 17:46:47] Tom: Todays is too hard
[09/11/2022, 17:46:52] Tom: I’m not entering the contest
[09/11/2022, 17:50:12] George Sheen: That's okay
[09/11/2022, 17:50:32] George Sheen: Your role was more of one of those kids that walks onto the pitch holding the football players' hands
[09/11/2022, 17:50:56] Tom: Agreed
[09/11/2022, 17:51:16] Joe: Do you mean the sub 2 min contest, or have you given up completely?
[09/11/2022, 17:51:25] Tom: Completely

[09/11/2022, 17:52:10] George Sheen: oooooph
[09/11/2022, 17:52:13] Joe: I think he's done "alive" as an answer to a similar clue before
[09/11/2022, 17:52:22] Joe: But instead I pissed away a minute with "algae"
[09/11/2022, 17:52:25] George Sheen: My piss sits to be supped another day
[09/11/2022, 17:52:29] George Sheen: But nice one on the high score
[09/11/2022, 17:52:37] Joe: Thank you, I put a lot into it
[09/11/2022, 17:55:13] Joe: Maybe sub 2 was possible without this misdirect
[09/11/2022, 17:55:19] Joe: I kept trying to put TROUT in
[09/11/2022, 17:56:55] George Sheen: Clearly you didn't notice that TROT are among the few letters repeated on the board, and the plusword starts with U
[09/11/2022, 17:57:12] George Sheen: Not my fault if you misinterpret a very direct hint
[09/11/2022, 17:59:53] Joe: You should have catered your hint to your audience

[11/11/2022, 00:53:39] Harvey Williams: I had a mistake in my grid that accounted for 1 min of fumbling on the plusword

[11/11/2022, 16:23:43] George Sheen: e
[11/11/2022, 16:24:17] George Sheen: just punch in whatever your instincts tell you for either all the acrosses/downs and then go straight to PW
[11/11/2022, 16:24:29] George Sheen: It maximises chances of the new elusive goal of sub-15
[11/11/2022, 16:24:39] George Sheen: but also worsens times overall
[11/11/2022, 16:28:55] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: we need the bold pioneering spirit that Harvey showed
[11/11/2022, 16:29:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: someone to plough through at 1am and send word back to the sleepy boys that a low time is on the cards

[11/11/2022, 16:30:48] Tom: No need to play again

[11/11/2022, 16:35:05] Joe: This man performs under pressure
[11/11/2022, 16:35:19] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: it was a genuinely stressful experience
[11/11/2022, 16:35:38] Joe: CL works in mysterious ways
[11/11/2022, 16:36:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also didn't clock until just afterwards that POPPY on 11/11 is probably not a coincidence
[11/11/2022, 16:36:17] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: CL remembering in his own unique way
[11/11/2022, 16:36:30] Joe: Yeah same here, probably could've put it in before even looking at the board
[11/11/2022, 16:37:28] George Sheen: The Telegraph readers will like that one
[11/11/2022, 16:37:39] George Sheen: If this was on the Guardian it would have been JINGOISM
[11/11/2022, 16:37:54] George Sheen: But they're not very good with letters and numbers
[11/11/2022, 16:41:10] George Sheen: Did you go private mode for today's tour de force Oli?
[11/11/2022, 16:42:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: no
[11/11/2022, 16:42:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: but I'm home from work so the popup and script blockers are out in force
[11/11/2022, 16:42:29] George Sheen: I really need to get on this
[11/11/2022, 16:43:03] George Sheen: Very glad to hear the Telegraph's annoying bombardment didn't cause a sub 15 to slip away
[11/11/2022, 16:43:38] Harvey Williams: He went deathly quiet on discord for the full duration, then breathlessly and tearfully said, "I just did plusword in 17 seconds".
[11/11/2022, 16:44:11] George Sheen: We need to remember this day
[11/11/2022, 16:44:21] George Sheen: Can't think of a name for that though
[11/11/2022, 16:44:22] Harvey Williams: But how
[11/11/2022, 16:44:28] George Sheen: Do you have a favourite flower, Oli?
[11/11/2022, 16:44:35] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: love a poppy
[11/11/2022, 16:44:44] Harvey Williams: how about remember remember the 11th of November
[11/11/2022, 16:45:07] George Sheen: Disappointing, I wanted to be more disruptive than that for future November 11ths
[11/11/2022, 16:45:14] George Sheen: Walk around with a dandelion on my lapel
[11/11/2022, 16:45:30] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what's the opposite of a poppy
[11/11/2022, 16:45:47] Harvey Williams: How about a butternut squash
[11/11/2022, 16:45:47] George Sheen: Snappy or a crackly
[11/11/2022, 16:45:49] George Sheen: But they're not things
[11/11/2022, 16:46:01] George Sheen: That was my third guess

[17/11/2022, 15:17:47] Joe: So they progress to the next round without playing
[17/11/2022, 15:17:48] George Sheen: Isn't a bye in tournaments where you skip a round?

[28/11/2022, 17:35:41] Harvey Williams: He was being le trol
[28/11/2022, 17:35:46] Harvey Williams: Classic George-san
[28/11/2022, 17:35:54] Harvey Williams: sub 40 years haha XD
[28/11/2022, 17:36:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: really fucked myself by assuming fossil was "HELIX" in what I can only assume was some kind of Pokémon themed stroke
[28/11/2022, 17:37:14] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: which allowed me to lock in CHAFE
[28/11/2022, 17:37:22] Harvey Williams: How 2014 of you
[28/11/2022, 17:37:23] Tom: I tried SHELL which was one of my weakest guesses of all time
[28/11/2022, 17:37:24] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: completely fucked up the whole thing
[28/11/2022, 17:39:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the real problem was the other guess "confirming" it
[28/11/2022, 17:39:54] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I spent a long time trying to work out some variant of CRADS as graduates
[28/11/2022, 17:40:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: in retrospect it should have become clear sooner
[28/11/2022, 17:42:13] George Sheen: This is why you should start with the downs
[28/11/2022, 17:42:18] George Sheen: I wish I had started with GRADS
[28/11/2022, 17:42:49] George Sheen: Really I think the best strat was get 1D and then slam in the acrosses, but I didn't want to overwhelm your olfactory receptors
[28/11/2022, 17:42:51] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: starting with the downs got me nothing but ALIVE

[29/11/2022, 00:06:57] Joe: But I fucked it
[29/11/2022, 00:07:22] Joe: I suspect I won't be the only one to fuck it in that way

[29/11/2022, 17:40:11] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: also missed a coloured letter because frankly there are a lot of them in this grid
[29/11/2022, 17:40:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: which probably cost me a few seconds

[29/11/2022, 17:52:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you seem very certain about which clue I missed a word of
[29/11/2022, 17:53:25] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: actually looking over the clues it's probably pretty obvious isn't it
[29/11/2022, 17:53:39] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: given half of them are one word
[29/11/2022, 17:53:48] George Sheen: i meant the second part
[29/11/2022, 17:53:56] George Sheen: The unheard of one was a red herring
[29/11/2022, 17:54:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I do not know what it is

[04/12/2022, 15:24:43] George Sheen: Frustrated that I now squandered a couple of seconds because the Plusword website is excellently programmed and the timer starts if you switch tab and then go back, even though the tutorial blurb is still there

[05/12/2022, 17:39:34] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: and I shan't be googling it
[05/12/2022, 17:39:51] Joe: I had the same 5/9 crossover issue, and the tricky plusword did not help
[05/12/2022, 17:40:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I don't enjoy crossovers of two things I don't know
[05/12/2022, 17:50:49] George Sheen: I have fun facts about 5D but cannot share them until everyone has endured it
[05/12/2022, 17:51:14] George Sheen: It is a term I'd heard before, the geographical crossover gave me more trouble
[05/12/2022, 17:51:56] George Sheen: I have at least heard the 3D word before but never would have got it from the clue alone
[05/12/2022, 17:52:04] George Sheen: This is good going

[06/12/2022, 00:02:22] Tom: Yeah wtf
[06/12/2022, 00:02:28] George Sheen: We called them coneys before we called them rabbits
[06/12/2022, 00:02:48] George Sheen: But it was pronounced "cunny" so everyone used it to mean a woman's holey bits
‎[06/12/2022, 00:03:04] George Sheen: ‎<attached: 00006817-PHOTO-2022-12-06-00-03-04.jpg>
[06/12/2022, 00:03:18] George Sheen: we changed the pronounciation because no-one wanted to change the bible
[06/12/2022, 00:03:51] George Sheen: I'm going to go back to calling both rabbits and vaginas coneys
[06/12/2022, 00:05:01] Tom: Connyfoggle
[06/12/2022, 00:05:03] Tom: What a word
[06/12/2022, 00:05:19] Tom: Definitely going to drop that in more often
[06/12/2022, 00:05:48] George Sheen: The lost art of the connyfoggle

[06/12/2022, 15:19:28] George Sheen: Nice ones all
[06/12/2022, 15:21:01] George Sheen: I dodged those thankfully, I think I got 7A and 9A off the bat which made the downs quite nice
[06/12/2022, 15:21:33] George Sheen: At least 2D and 3D were
[06/12/2022, 15:34:39] Tom: I did adore
[06/12/2022, 15:35:24] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: IDAHO famously not a city
[06/12/2022, 15:35:28] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: which I think makes it worse
[06/12/2022, 15:58:38] Joe: I went for adore yeah, but Idaho is famously not a city as you say
[06/12/2022, 15:59:03] Joe: I just accepted early on that I wouldn't get the city and ignored that clue
[06/12/2022, 16:01:04] Tom: Warren buffet - wizard of OMAHA
[06/12/2022, 20:26:40] George Sheen: niche knowledge
[06/12/2022, 20:46:38] Tom: Very true
[06/12/2022, 20:46:48] Tom: Not much going on in the Midwest

[07/12/2022, 09:05:21] Tom: This one is tricky
[07/12/2022, 09:05:25] Tom: I have a grid
[07/12/2022, 09:05:33] Tom: Probably wrong though
[07/12/2022, 09:05:54] George Sheen: Diurnally dim
[07/12/2022, 09:06:38] Tom: Extremely
[07/12/2022, 09:07:01] George Sheen: 9-10.30 is famously the worst time to try a PW though
[07/12/2022, 09:07:37] George Sheen: It probably extends to times earlier in the morning than 9 but I've never been masochistic enough to try
‎[07/12/2022, 09:09:04] Joe: ‎<attached: 00006856-PHOTO-2022-12-07-09-09-04.jpg>

[07/12/2022, 09:09:28] Tom: Wow
[07/12/2022, 09:09:27] George Sheen: Well done for throwing a sub-30 away
[07/12/2022, 09:09:31] Tom: Nice one
[07/12/2022, 09:09:37] George Sheen: Sub-20, even
[07/12/2022, 09:09:39] Joe: Thank you
[07/12/2022, 09:09:45] Joe: There are fast possibilities certainly
[07/12/2022, 09:10:23] Joe: 6 and 8 are a bit fucked but I never looked at those answers
[07/12/2022, 09:10:42] Joe: Just got a couple of confident hozzas then hit all the verts
[07/12/2022, 09:11:46] George Sheen: Love the diction
[07/12/2022, 09:12:06] George Sheen: Makes PW sound like a hip and alternative sport like surfing
[07/12/2022, 09:12:11] George Sheen: But less homosexual
[07/12/2022, 09:16:16] Tom: I think 3/6 is ruining me
[07/12/2022, 09:17:07] Joe: You can simplify that fraction to 1/2
[07/12/2022, 09:20:14] George Sheen: Maths degree coming in handy
[07/12/2022, 09:20:33] George Sheen: Does your teacher want the answer as a fraction or decimal?
‎[07/12/2022, 09:31:51] Tom: ‎<attached: 00006873-PHOTO-2022-12-07-09-31-51.jpg>

[07/12/2022, 09:32:28] Tom: Thanks for this
[07/12/2022, 09:32:53] Joe: That makes sense, 8 is fucked and has an obvious alternative that could fit

[07/12/2022, 09:35:20] Tom: Thanks
[07/12/2022, 10:07:09] George Sheen: I tried to do a fat line of hints before attempting and it ruined me
[07/12/2022, 10:07:28] Tom: Gutted
[07/12/2022, 10:07:28] George Sheen: Decided to immediately ignore the clues for 3,6,8 and let the chips fall where they may

[07/12/2022, 10:08:00] George Sheen: I definitely should have tried to do to form a backbone
[07/12/2022, 10:08:19] George Sheen: *tried to do 3 and 6
[07/12/2022, 10:08:22] George Sheen: agree 8 is wacky though
[07/12/2022, 10:10:27] Joe: Yeah I thought you'd get 6 tbh George, and 3 ain't a tricky one
[07/12/2022, 10:10:47] George Sheen: Yeah I skipped 3 which meant I put the wrong answer for 9
[07/12/2022, 10:11:06] George Sheen: And then there was no salvaging it
[07/12/2022, 10:11:22] George Sheen: .

[07/12/2022, 23:13:46] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the 8/2 crossover is what's getting me

[07/12/2022, 23:15:09] Tom: I don’t care what the archaic spelling is

[09/12/2022, 10:36:47] Joe: Yeah it was a bit
[09/12/2022, 10:36:54] Joe: I struggled over the pw for a bit
[09/12/2022, 11:03:50] George Sheen: Yeah he was a bit of a dick on multiple fronts today
[09/12/2022, 11:04:14] George Sheen: No clues I steadfastly disagree with, but he knew he was ruining some mornings with some of the ones in there
[09/12/2022, 11:05:01] George Sheen: And he gives you digested and regurgitated crumbs to work with for the PW
[09/12/2022, 11:15:06] Joe: That's the worst part really. He knows exactly what he's doing to us and he takes pleasure in it

[21/12/2022, 11:22:35] Joe: The best CL's done in a while

[21/12/2022, 11:31:24] George Sheen: My advice would be go 1A and 6, and then it's possible to smash in all 5 downs without looking at the rest of the acrosses
[21/12/2022, 11:31:44] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: these hints are getting very specific
[21/12/2022, 11:31:44] George Sheen: That's what I did anyway, except I wasted time looking at and briefly thinking about the clues for 7, 8, 9
[21/12/2022, 11:31:59] George Sheen: I want 17 seconds to be beaten
[21/12/2022, 11:32:05] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: no promises

[21/12/2022, 11:34:55] Joe: This is basically what I did
[21/12/2022, 11:35:25] Harvey Williams: So you guys didn't do the other anag then
[21/12/2022, 11:35:46] Joe: I left the anag and let the verts sort it
[21/12/2022, 11:36:11] Harvey Williams: I'm finding more and more than the downs are easier
[21/12/2022, 11:36:23] Harvey Williams: But the next clue button on mobile goes numerically
[21/12/2022, 12:24:56] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I find whichever I do last is easier because I already have some letters done
[21/12/2022, 12:25:07] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so why worry about it
[21/12/2022, 13:34:59] Tom: BIG claim

[21/12/2022, 13:38:35] Tom: They’ll get the plussy straight away
[21/12/2022, 13:48:36] Joe: Love the plussy
[22/12/2022, 09:19:14] George Sheen: What an understatement
[22/12/2022, 09:19:27] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: sorry lads
[22/12/2022, 09:20:15] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: i wanted to do it properly with no interruptions
[22/12/2022, 09:20:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so I waited until the end of the day and then instead of doing plusword I went to the pub
[22/12/2022, 09:20:54] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: can't believe I missed this
[22/12/2022, 09:21:04] George Sheen: But that's the perfect place to do it
[22/12/2022, 09:21:20] George Sheen: It was quite crushable
[22/12/2022, 09:24:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: tempted to sign up for the free trial of telegraph puzzles for the archive feature
[22/12/2022, 09:32:56] Joe: It was quite an error to make
[22/12/2022, 09:33:48] Joe: CL won't forgive it
[22/12/2022, 09:34:04] Joe: Expect monstrous grids for the next few weeks

[22/12/2022, 09:42:58] Joe: I reckon half of that was on the plussy
[22/12/2022, 10:19:37] George Sheen: CL has done this to show his pleasure at being one entrant short yesterday

[22/12/2022, 10:20:23] George Sheen: I did make a bit of a meal of the board, but now am on the Plussie and it's even worse
[22/12/2022, 10:20:35] George Sheen: You can't live in the past forever
[22/12/2022, 10:21:01] George Sheen: You need to face up to CL's present sadism eventually
[22/12/2022, 10:21:32] Tom: Hah I started this last night and gave it after like 10 mins
[22/12/2022, 10:21:37] Tom: It’s a shitter

[22/12/2022, 10:24:05] George Sheen: i meant displeasure, the plusword has cognitively ruined me
[22/12/2022, 10:24:14] Joe: I had to put in some very shaky answers on my way to grid completion
[22/12/2022, 10:24:58] Joe: Basically none could be put in confidently until there were other words crossing them
[22/12/2022, 10:25:05] Joe: Other than one faecal general knowledge question
[22/12/2022, 10:25:59] George Sheen: Yeah there's one that I initially thought was an auto-input, turns out there are three answers with the same starting letter and it's the last one I thought to try of the three

[22/12/2022, 10:29:12] George Sheen: and I was wrong
[22/12/2022, 10:29:14] Harvey Williams: Ah shit
[22/12/2022, 10:29:30] George Sheen: Only one word is wrong though
[22/12/2022, 10:29:54] Harvey Williams: Is it 9
[22/12/2022, 10:29:58] George Sheen: No
[22/12/2022, 10:30:02] Harvey Williams: That's the only one that doesn't crush my dreams
[22/12/2022, 10:30:21] George Sheen: There's another that doesn't
[22/12/2022, 10:30:36] George Sheen: There's one that if changed opens up a whole new dreamscape in which you can frolick
[22/12/2022, 10:30:48] Harvey Williams: 7
[22/12/2022, 10:30:50] Harvey Williams: I like 7

[22/12/2022, 10:31:12] George Sheen: Sometimes we have to sacrifice those we love the most
[22/12/2022, 10:31:20] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: but i've been staring at the plussy for about two and half minutes

[22/12/2022, 10:31:29] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what could this possibly be
[22/12/2022, 10:31:29] Joe: This is what I meant, but written more poetically
[22/12/2022, 10:31:30] Harvey Williams: I think I know a word that ends in those two letter but I don't remember it
[22/12/2022, 10:31:33] Harvey Williams: Silly law shit
[22/12/2022, 10:31:40] Joe: Right? So few vowels
[22/12/2022, 10:33:15] George Sheen: The PW is maybe the cuntiest one I can ever remember him doing
[22/12/2022, 10:33:36] Joe: If only Oli had done yesterday's, maybe things would be different
[22/12/2022, 10:35:31] George Sheen: This one is seeming increasingly nicer by the minute
[22/12/2022, 10:36:22] George Sheen: CL wouldn't have struck back with a vengeance when he saw there were only 4 responses to his gentle, easy one

[22/12/2022, 18:10:45] Joe: What do we reckon will be the plussy solution on xmas day? I'm vibing SANTA, but I don't know if it's really a word
[22/12/2022, 18:11:42] George Sheen: Not with the form he's on
[22/12/2022, 18:11:50] George Sheen: It'll be something like YULEN
[22/12/2022, 18:12:04] George Sheen: An archaic / made up word meaning referring to Christmas
[22/12/2022, 18:12:19] Joe: Sadly you are probably right
[22/12/2022, 18:13:03] George Sheen: In case he's in the Christmas spirit, SANTA is a good one to have in mind
[22/12/2022, 18:13:06] George Sheen: HOLLY too
[22/12/2022, 18:13:27] George Sheen: SNOWY is slightly cunty so might fit well

[23/12/2022, 00:20:06] George Sheen: Haha it was only natural, I also went down a gnome path at some point
[23/12/2022, 00:20:23] George Sheen: Those silent Gs lead to silent Ks though and those silent Ks lead to greatness
[23/12/2022, 00:20:32] George Sheen: so such asinine guesses so pay off really
[23/12/2022, 00:20:54] George Sheen: do
[23/12/2022, 00:29:41] Joe: I went down a very similar path to you George

[03/01/2023, 11:06:56] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: love duelling pistols me
[03/01/2023, 11:20:33] George Sheen: pew pew
[03/01/2023, 11:20:56] George Sheen: It is definitely the moustache
[03/01/2023, 11:21:01] George Sheen: I'm duelling for your wagon, your wenches, and your pride
[03/01/2023, 11:21:35] George Sheen: Speaking of duelling pistols, I looked into full-cock / half-cock etymology and apparently I've been using these phrases wrong all my life
[03/01/2023, 11:22:44] George Sheen: I thought half-cock was like half assed / non-commitedly and full-cock would be to go balls deep into something (not for anatomical reasons)
[03/01/2023, 11:23:19] George Sheen: But apparently.half cock is to fly into something without preparation, like letting your flintlock go off before it's fully cocked
[03/01/2023, 11:23:36] George Sheen: So by extension full cock would be to do something with appropriate planning and readiness
[03/01/2023, 11:23:57] Harvey Williams: I thought full cock was something we called you behind your back
[03/01/2023, 11:24:09] Harvey Williams: TIL it has another meaning
[03/01/2023, 11:24:15] George Sheen: I don't know if I'm ready to give up the ideas of rogering a situation with half/all of your Cock though
[03/01/2023, 11:24:31] George Sheen: That's awfully complimentary of you, thanks guys
[03/01/2023, 11:24:51] George Sheen: I don't want to be the only one talking about how full of cock I am
[03/01/2023, 11:25:28] George Sheen: which is another phrase open to interpretation
[03/01/2023, 11:25:43] George Sheen: but very positive either way
[03/01/2023, 11:28:12] Harvey Williams: I'm going to ignore all this and bask in the heat of my reddit-esque burn
[03/01/2023, 11:28:23] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I solved this by literally never referring to anything as full cocked
[03/01/2023, 11:28:50] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: but "to go off half cocked" surely gives it away
[03/01/2023, 11:29:10] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I liked it
[03/01/2023, 11:34:38] George Sheen: Sounds like deep-rooted penis envy to me

[13/01/2023, 10:27:17] George Sheen: the plusword took me a few moments too, letter overload
[13/01/2023, 10:30:54] George Sheen: Also I hadn't heard of the word in the clue for 4d before, but upon looking it up it looks like CL might have tried to be more intelligent than his readers and fucked it up AGAIN
[13/01/2023, 10:32:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: these are some intimidating times
[13/01/2023, 10:54:00] George Sheen: But definitely improvable

[13/01/2023, 13:23:41] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I would definitely not have got 1D, 2 and probably not 4
[13/01/2023, 13:24:07] George Sheen: Yeah, I was proud of myself for knowing 2d but ultimately needed 6a knowledge if I wanted to beat any pb's
[13/01/2023, 13:24:16] George Sheen: 1D I also had no clue
[13/01/2023, 13:24:31] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I feel that 6A is more obvious than 2D, which is a word i have never come across

[13/01/2023, 13:28:30] George Sheen: With a separate meaning in English that is related but not at all the same
[13/01/2023, 13:28:33] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: this would not stand in a crossword of repute
[13/01/2023, 13:28:45] George Sheen: And he's put an indefinite article in the clue for no real reason

[17/01/2023, 10:26:12] George Sheen: If we all apply mental WD40 and keep our brains free of stiffies we could be on for a group average PB
[17/01/2023, 10:26:25] Joe: Big if
[17/01/2023, 10:26:52] George Sheen: When accounting for those of us who let the team down on the otherwise magical day of Christmas Day 2022 anyway

[17/01/2023, 10:27:58] George Sheen: The patterns are fascinating
[17/01/2023, 10:28:24] George Sheen: All I can say is that it fully justifies late owl superiority

[17/01/2023, 10:31:55] George Sheen: Sub minny -> late owl; otherwise -> early cuck
[17/01/2023, 10:32:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: we need a plusbot to automate this process
[17/01/2023, 10:33:40] George Sheen: We really do
[17/01/2023, 10:34:03] George Sheen: One that also harasses stragglers who haven't submitted with increasing frequency as the day draws on
[17/01/2023, 10:34:59] Harvey Williams: Is it time to write some python stuff
[17/01/2023, 10:34:59] Harvey Williams: Dunno how integration with WhatsApp works

[17/01/2023, 10:35:23] Joe: I'm willing to put £5 into the plusbot development fund
[17/01/2023, 10:35:49] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think you can create business accounts for WhatsApp
[17/01/2023, 10:35:54] Harvey Williams: Hmm doesn't look good for using whatsapp
[17/01/2023, 10:35:58] Harvey Williams: It's mostly chat flow stuff
[17/01/2023, 10:36:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: might be able to automate that somehow
[17/01/2023, 10:36:07] Harvey Williams: If we were on discord I could have it done
[17/01/2023, 10:36:18] Harvey Williams: Get some text parsing software to log times
[17/01/2023, 10:36:55] George Sheen: Text parsing as in like an OCR?
[17/01/2023, 10:36:56] Joe: I'd put £10 into a fund to create our own private messaging app. Needs e2e enc + mobile app & browser options
[17/01/2023, 10:37:09] George Sheen: Not that I have any idea what I'm talking about
[17/01/2023, 10:37:15] George Sheen: But it would need to read text from images right
[17/01/2023, 10:37:21] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: enjoy my flashy photos, plusbot
[17/01/2023, 10:37:24] Joe: You could make a browser extension to auto-send times to the chat as well
[17/01/2023, 10:37:30] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: call me captcha
[17/01/2023, 10:37:34] George Sheen: I'd put at least £10.20 for this
[17/01/2023, 10:38:01] George Sheen: £10.80 if the bot can be trusted with this
[17/01/2023, 10:38:01] Joe: Probably yes, which is quite easy these days. But if we had browser integration then it could do it without the need for OCR
[17/01/2023, 10:39:43] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I think it might be excessive to ask Harvey to write browser extensions for every available variation on browser which we might use just to log plusword times
[17/01/2023, 10:40:40] George Sheen: To that I say...
[17/01/2023, 10:40:48] George Sheen: £11.40

[17/01/2023, 10:45:44] George Sheen: I punted on entirely the wrong one for 7A though and that led to a lot of sloppy fingerwork later trying to right the wrongs
[17/01/2023, 10:46:58] Harvey Williams: And one you'd install on your work pc
[17/01/2023, 10:47:12] Harvey Williams: Not that writing an extension would be very difficult for reading a field
[17/01/2023, 10:47:37] Harvey Williams: I've been tempted to write a pokemonshowdown for type chart stuff for ages
[17/01/2023, 10:48:44] George Sheen: I feel like those words should resonate the most with me but I also don't understand the sentence
[17/01/2023, 10:49:03] Harvey Williams: Extension is missing
[17/01/2023, 10:49:14] George Sheen: Ah yeah
[17/01/2023, 10:49:28] George Sheen: Does PS not show you type effectiveness now?

[17/01/2023, 10:54:02] Harvey Williams: The games do
[17/01/2023, 10:54:11] Harvey Williams: In that they show super or nve

[17/01/2023, 14:15:25] Joe: Yeah the way it tries to guess which direction you want can be very annoying
[17/01/2023, 14:15:46] Joe: Glad to see proof that worms are better brain food than voles

[19/01/2023, 14:59:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: my god
[19/01/2023, 14:59:06] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: all this data
[19/01/2023, 14:59:41] Joe: I only went back to the last day in November that we all participated in
[19/01/2023, 14:59:52] Harvey Williams: Is all of that done by hand
[19/01/2023, 14:59:57] Joe: I've deleted a lot of the pics from my phone & think I'd have problems pulling older dates
[19/01/2023, 15:00:01] Joe: Yes by hand, took like 1h30
[19/01/2023, 15:00:06] Harvey Williams: That's passion
[19/01/2023, 15:00:21] Joe: And due to deleted pics there's some missing times. I could see when they were sent, so I put that in, but couldn't see the pw time
[19/01/2023, 15:01:00] Joe: Congratulations @447400975974 on the longest ongoing streak - since 22/12
[19/01/2023, 15:01:40] Tom: Very nice
[19/01/2023, 15:01:45] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: thank you
[19/01/2023, 15:02:03] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: who has been deleting pics
[19/01/2023, 15:02:27] Tom: Look at only poor Joe submitting times over Christmas
[19/01/2023, 15:02:31] Tom: True dedication
[19/01/2023, 15:02:45] Tom: I need to find out what days I was hungover to workout the effect on my times too
[19/01/2023, 15:03:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: did I really submit a time at 6:43am?
[19/01/2023, 15:03:44] Joe: I mean I deleted them from my phone, and whatsapp won't let me re-download
[19/01/2023, 15:04:02] Harvey Williams: My phone marks them as memes
[19/01/2023, 15:04:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I did
[19/01/2023, 15:04:05] Joe: If it's in the excel then you should believe it blindly. But also be prepared for errors from fat fingers
[19/01/2023, 15:04:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: what the fuck
[19/01/2023, 15:04:15] Joe: Early bird
[19/01/2023, 15:04:27] Tom: It knows
[19/01/2023, 15:04:38] Joe: It was the fastest time that day, so...
[19/01/2023, 15:05:24] Joe: The christmas times are the victim of image deletion. Wherever there's a submitted time there should be a pw time, but I couldn't see it
[19/01/2023, 15:05:46] Tom: Ahhh I see
[19/01/2023, 15:08:32] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I haven't deleted any images
[19/01/2023, 15:08:44] Joe: I deleted them
[19/01/2023, 15:08:49] Joe: From my phone
[19/01/2023, 15:08:58] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: yeah
[19/01/2023, 15:08:59] Joe: So whatsapp cucks me and only shows me a blurry thumbnail when I try to go back
[19/01/2023, 15:09:02] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: I didn't do that
[19/01/2023, 15:09:07] Joe: Ah
[19/01/2023, 15:09:09] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: so I can help fill in the blanks
[19/01/2023, 15:09:09] Joe: Fill it in lad
[19/01/2023, 15:09:12] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: later
[19/01/2023, 15:09:21] Joe: 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
[19/01/2023, 15:09:35] Joe: Together we will achieve greatness
[19/01/2023, 15:10:01] Tom: I haven’t deleted anything though @447969445849
[19/01/2023, 15:10:09] Joe: Lol shush Tom
[19/01/2023, 15:10:26] Joe: We will also find who the true plusword munger is
[19/01/2023, 15:10:36] Joe: I expect insightful graphs on my desk by 9am
[19/01/2023, 15:10:59] Tom: Unfortunately I haven’t got my pc with me 😔
[19/01/2023, 15:11:05] Tom: I can do Saturday morning though
[19/01/2023, 15:11:19] Tom: Unless our newest munger feels up to it
[19/01/2023, 15:11:48] Joe: Let George take a run at it, then you can show him how a real munge king does it
[19/01/2023, 15:12:07] Joe: You can also both laugh at my use of cell formatting and formulas to get what's in there
[19/01/2023, 15:12:23] Joe: I was focused on easy data entry though
[19/01/2023, 15:15:35] Tom: Also times are annoying to work with in excel
[19/01/2023, 15:16:01] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: you can multiply a time by 1440 to get a number of minutes
[19/01/2023, 15:16:44] ‪+44 7400 975974‬: the lazy man's choice

[19/01/2023, 16:23:38] George Sheen: Looks like you held up your & everyone who isn't Harvey's end of the bargain
[19/01/2023, 16:24:10] George Sheen: Now it's time for Harvey to make that WhatsApp-friendly bot to draw all future times into it
[19/01/2023, 16:24:45] George Sheen: I'm so experienced with munging now I don't actually do any of it anymore, and instead just project manage and delegate
[19/01/2023, 16:25:01] Clifford 🎄 :D: Yessss man

[19/01/2023, 20:14:52] Joe: But I can't remember what they're meant to be, and everything else looks decent lol
[19/01/2023, 20:15:29] Harvey Williams: Yeah they're not
[19/01/2023, 20:15:48] Harvey Williams: But I have full grid paralysis
[19/01/2023, 20:15:59] Joe: You do
[19/01/2023, 20:17:20] Tom: Yeah 6 is your downfall
[19/01/2023, 20:17:37] Tom: They’re both bad clues
[19/01/2023, 20:17:39] Joe: Just checked the clues, 6a is a bit of an "if you know you know"
[19/01/2023, 20:17:44] Tom: I think 6 is a colour
[19/01/2023, 20:17:52] Joe: Naaah it's a pigment
[19/01/2023, 20:17:56] Joe: Oldest pigment known to man
[19/01/2023, 20:18:09] Tom: True but I know it as a colour first
[19/01/2023, 20:18:26] Tom: Probably from choosing it as colour in halo
[19/01/2023, 20:18:30] Joe: Lol fair, I don't know it as a colour
