# Plusword

## Project to allow display of the groups Plusword times

The data was extracted from a folder of screenshots which I exported from whatsapp and I used pytesseract to convert image to text.
Then I cleaned the data and added it to a mongoDB and created the visualisations.
Finally I built the streamlit app to add interactability and to display the visualisations

To recreate the app, clone the repo and create a new mongoDB called plusword containing the old data. Then run 'streamlit Home.py' to open the app in your browser
